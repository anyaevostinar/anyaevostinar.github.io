    <p>Just a quick post to announce the publication of a review article from this past fall <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.739047/full">Symbiosis in Digital Evolution: Past, Present, and Future</a>.
The review is aimed primarily at ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in how the technique/field of digital evolution can be used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis. 
However, a secondary audience that we kept in mind while writing are those already working in digital evolution and artificial life who are interested in the research space of symbiosis and a history of digital evolution through the lens of symbiosis.
I also generally aim to make all of my papers accessible to my undergraduate students, so I hope that it will be interesting and understandable to a wide range of readers.</p>

<p>Highlights from the paper:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A history of symbiosis in digital evolution from the very beginning of the field, including some little-known digital evolution systems</li>
  <li>A middle-ground and extensively considered definition of digital evolution</li>
  <li>A briefer discussion of the definition of symbiosis</li>
  <li>A lovely figure depicting the main components of symbiosis in a hypothetical digital evolution system.</li>
  <li>An overview and synthesis of the findings regarding symbiosis found using digital evolution</li>
  <li>A list of the current digital evolution software that supports symbiosis in some form and a comparison of their functionalities</li>
  <li>A whole bunch of open research questions and directions about symbiosis that digital evolution is well-suited to investigate</li>
  <li>A call for specific improvements and innovations in digital evolution software that will be necessary to push forward investigation into symbiotic dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>
