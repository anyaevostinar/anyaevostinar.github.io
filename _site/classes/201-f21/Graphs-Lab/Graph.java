/**
 * A common interface for the Graph ADT, encompassing graphs both unweighted and
 * weighted, undirected and directed.  Note that an object of Graph type can't
 * add edges to itself; the sub-interfaces UnweightedGraph and WeightedGraph
 * contain the necessary methods for adding edges.
 *   Note that this particular interface explicitly refers to vertices by a
 * consecutive set of integral vertex IDs, from 0 to N-1 (where N is the number
 * of vertices), and conceives of edges only in terms of their endpoints.
 * This is the canonical conception of a graph for standard graph algorithms,
 * but lacks common features for modeling, e.g., a road network.
 *   To represent metadata like vertex labels, it is recommended that the user
 * maintain their own dictionaries mapping between vertex IDs (or pairs thereof,
 * for edges) and the desired values.
 * 
 *   Any method that takes one or more vertex IDs as arguments may throw an
 * IndexOutOfBoundsException if any input ID is out of bounds.
