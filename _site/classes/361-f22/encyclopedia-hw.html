  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>This is an individual assignment, so you should complete it on your own, though you are able to get help from many sources as detailed in the syllabus.</p>

<p>This assignment has several intermediate due dates. The first is the topic choice, which is due October 12th at 10pm.
See the <a href="#due-dates">full list of dates below</a>.
As with all assignments, you will have the opportunity to revise this assignment based on the feedback that you get.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The goals of this assignment are two-fold.
First, being able to explain scientific and engineering concepts is equally as important as being able to discover new knowledge.
The <a href="https://alife.org/encyclopedia/">Encyclopedia of Artificial Life</a> is a relatively new resource that aims to explain all facets of artificial life to the general public and newcomers to the field.
For this assignment, you will research and write a potential contribution to the encyclopedia.
If you want, you will even be able to actually contribute it!</p>

<p>Second, you will need to come up with a software project in the second half of the term that recreates and extends previous artificial life research.
This assignment is a good opportunity to learn more about an area of artificial life that interests you and therefore help you think of what kind of software project you would like to do.</p>

<h2 id="assignment-specification">Assignment Specification</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you need to write a section of text that could be contributed to the <a href="https://alife.org/encyclopedia/">Encyclopedia of Artificial Life</a>.</p>

<h3 id="length">Length</h3>
<p>Your section can be either a new page or a new section of an existing page, but should be <strong>at least four paragraphs</strong> focused on an artificial life topic.
You could also do a video as part of your section if you want; reach out to me if that is of interest to you.</p>

<h3 id="topic">Topic</h3>
<p>Your text should be on a topic or subtopic that would be a new contribution to the encyclopedia, meaning the page should not already exist, or your text should fit well within the content that is already there.
There are many, many pages that still need to be written, and you can view <a href="https://alife.org/encyclopedia/about/list-of-articles-to-write/">a list here</a>. 
All of the existing pages also could have more detail and sections added, so if you are interested in a topic that already has a page, look to see what about that topic isn’t already discussed.</p>

<p>You won’t be allowed to write on the identical topic as someone else in the class, though it is fine to write different sections on a related topic. 
Fill out the form on Moodle to claim your topic; they will be first come first serve, so doing this sooner than later is a good idea. 
There is a running <a href="#claimed-topics">list of already claimed topics</a> at the end of the page.</p>

<h3 id="references">References</h3>
<p>You will need to include at least two references to outside sources in your text. 
These can be to scientific articles, software, books, or other resources. 
You can use any citation format in your assignment; if you end up submitting your text to the encyclopedia, they have a <a href="https://alife.org/encyclopedia/about/how-to-contribute-to-the-alife-encyclopedia/">particular format</a> that you’ll need to switch to later.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="#resources">list of resources below</a> of places to look for references.</p>

<h3 id="tone">Tone</h3>
<p>You should consult other articles on the encyclopedia for reference on the tone to use in this text.
Generally, you should aim for your text to be understandable by a general audience while also being informative to people in the artificial life community.
A good audience to think of is your peers in this course and/or your friends not in this course, depending on which section of an article you are writing.</p>

<h2 id="submitting">Submitting</h2>
<p>Please do the following to submit your text for each draft:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Put your text into a Google Doc (or update your existing doc) with your Carleton account</li>
  <li>Turn on link sharing for Carleton College as “Commenter”</li>
  <li>Copy that link and submit it to the assignment on Moodle</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Your assignment will ultimately be assessed by the following criteria.</p>

<h3 id="proficiency">Proficiency</h3>
<p>To demonstrate proficiency on this assignment, it needs to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include at least two references that are appropriate for the chosen topic</li>
  <li>Be at least four paragraphs in length</li>
  <li>Explain something about a topic within artificial life for a general audience</li>
  <li>Demonstrate a proficient understanding of the topic</li>
  <li>Use appropriate grammar and tone</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mastery">Mastery</h3>
<p>To demonstrate mastery on this assignment, it needs to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include at least two references, one of which is a peer-reviewed scientific article</li>
  <li>Accurately summarize information from both of the references for a general audience</li>
  <li>Have at least four well-organized and clear paragraphs</li>

  <li><strong>Be ready to</strong> make a contribution to the Encyclopedia of Artificial Life that is useful to readers in the artificial life community (<strong>actually submitting is not necessary</strong>)</li>
  <li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic and convey that understanding to the reader</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="claimed-topics">Claimed Topics</h2>
<p>These are topics that others are already approved to do, so you should make sure that you don’t overlap with them.
If you want to do something related to one of these, feel free to talk to me about how you can make sure that your topic is different enough.</p>
