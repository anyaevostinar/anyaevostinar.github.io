    <p>This is a lab assignment and so you will not be submitting it.
However, the concepts and practice will help you on both the homework and exams so I encourage you to make a serious effort on it during class and consider finishing it outside of class.</p>

<p>I recommend making a folder for today’s lab in COURSES as you usually do.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-0">Exercise 0</h2>
<p>(As always, this is a repeat of the demonstration in class.)</p>

<p>Download the zip file from Moodle for today’s lab and copy those files into your folder for today.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In text analysis, <strong>n-grams</strong> are phrases that are <em>n</em> words long that appear in sequence together. 
So, for instance “hello” is a <em>one-gram</em>, “black knight” is a <em>two-gram</em>, “spam and eggs” is a <em>three-gram</em>, etc.</p>

<p>A common first step in analyzing the contents of a document is to count up all the individual instances of each n-gram within it, generally for all values of n smaller than some relatively small number, like 3 or 4. 
Say we were going to count all the two-grams in the following text:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    To be, or not to be, that is the question.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first two-gram is “to be”, the second is “be or”, the third is “or not”, etc. 
Notice that the two-grams overlap with one another. 
In this particular text, the only two-gram that would have a count higher than 1 would be “to be”, which appears twice. 
<em>(Note: capitalization and punctuation are often ignored when performing n-gram analysis, though not always.)</em></p>

<p>Though this is a simple process as far as statistical analyses go, it can tell us quite a lot. As an example, comparing relative values of the proportions of n-grams within documents can help us algorithmically determine who wrote given documents (part of a broader branch of analysis called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry">stylometry</a>).</p>

<p>In this lab you’ll do some of this kind of analysis yourself using Python dictionaries.</p>

<h3 id="your-task">Your Task</h3>
<p>The zip that you downloaded contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ngrams.py</code>: the beginnings of an implementation that will let us count n-grams</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>: A file with some testing code for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ngrams.py</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">corpora/</code>: a directory of text files written by various famous authors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ngrams.py</code> and take a look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getOneGrams()</code>, a function that should count all the one-grams (i.e., words, otherwise known as “unigrams”) in a given file and returns the counts as a Python dictionary.
You’ll see that there is currently pseudocode where the main functionality should be.
<strong>Turn that pseudocode into Python to complete the function.</strong>
When you are done, running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.py</code> should print out the top 10 most frequent words in Hamlet.</p>

<p>You should get:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>the 1097
and 899
to 742
of 658
you 550
i 536
my 514
a 511
it 415
in 414
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>As interesting as Hamlet is, you will likely find that these top 10 words aren’t very interesting - at least, not in a way that would distinguish them from the top 10 words for any other play. 
Try changing the code to print out the top 10 words from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. 
Despite being a very different play, the words won’t have changed much. 
While we can learn a surprising amount from these small “function” words, they do tend to drown out more interesting topic/content words in frequency analysis.
An easy way to address this issue is to simply ignore such words when making our counts. Words that a researcher removes before performing analysis are typically called <strong>stopwords</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Add another parameter to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getOneGrams()</code> function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ignoreStopwords</code>.</strong>
This parameter should contain a Boolean value (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code>) indicating whether or not the function should ignore stopwords or consider them as it performs its counting. To implement this, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check whether or not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ignoreStopwords</code> is True, using a conditional statement</li>
  <li>Read in all of the words from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">corpora/stopwords.txt</code> and store them in a list (take a glance inside this file to see what it contains)</li>
  <li>For each word encountered in the given file, check to see whether or not that word is in the stopword list before adding its count to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oneGramCounts</code> dictionary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to add code to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> to test your new functionality. What words pop up now? Do they tell you more about what the play is about?</p>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
<p>For your second task of this lab, you will be implementing a similar function to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getOneGrams()</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTwoGrams()</code>. 
As the name suggests, this function will count all of the two-grams (or “bigrams”) contained in a given file, returning the counts as a dictionary.</p>

<p>Much of this function will do the same thing as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getOneGrams()</code>, but think about what extra variables you will need and how you will go about updating them. 
How will you keep track of not just the <em>current</em> word, but the <em>previous</em> word? 
<strong>How will you be able to make sure that you count two-grams that straddle across two lines of text?</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: do not bother to exclude stopwords as you count bigrams.</em></p>

<p>As you implement this function, add code to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function to test that your function is working.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h2>
<p>The code you were given removes all punctuation before counting any n-grams. This lets us keep track of all occurrences of each word, regardless of whether or not they might come at the end of a sentence, or after a quotation mark. However, we can incorporate punctuation into our n-grams if we want to. In particular, terminal punctuation marks (periods, question marks, exclamation points) contain useful information. If, say, the word “goodbye” occurs frequently at the end of a sentence, that is something we can capture by treating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">('goodbye', '.')</code> as a bigram.</p>

<p><strong>Update your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTwoGrams()</code> function so that it counts periods, exclamation points, and question marks <em>as their own words</em> when counting bigrams.</strong> 
(We can use the word “token” to refer to a single countable unit that could be a word or a punctuation mark.) 
This should be doable just by adding/changing a few lines of code!</p>
