    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>To analyze the time complexity of depth first and breadth first search.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>This is a lab assignment that you’ll be handing in on Moodle. You should complete it on Friday Feb 5th, but it isn’t due until Wednesday Feb 10th at 5:00pm Central (because Monday is midterm break).</p>

<p>This is a non-coding lab, so please open a text document to write your answers.</p>

<p>You’re welcome to work on this lab with input from one or more members of your collaborative learning group. You should write all of your own answers, but you’re welcome to share your screen with members of your collaborative learning group to look at one another’s answers, make suggestions, and compare ideas. Take a look at the Collaboration Policies document on Moodle if you have any questions about what’s permitted.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-0">Exercise 0</h2>
<p>Create a Collaborations header on your file where you can put citations to any help you receive from your collaborative learning group or outside websites. Even if you don’t get any help, include the section and state in it that you did not collaborate.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>First we’ll analyze the time complexity of the two graph implementations that you’ve seen. You are welcome to reference the code from the Graph Implementation activity.</p>

<p>When expressing the time complexity of graph algorithms, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">V</code> to mean the number of vertices in the graph and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code> to mean the number of edges in the graph.</p>

<p>a. What is the worst case time complexity of adding a vertex in an adjacency matrix graph implementation (without adding any edges)? Express your answer in big-O notation and write a sentence explaining why.</p>

<p>b. What is the worst case time complexity of adding a vertex in an adjacency <strong>list</strong> graph implementation (without adding any edges)? Express your answer in big-O notation and write a sentence explaining why.</p>

<p>c. What is the worst case time complexity of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getDegree</code> method of the adjacency matrix graph implementation in big-O notation? Write a sentence explaining why.</p>

<p>d. What is the worst case time complexity of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getDegree</code> method of the adjacency list graph implementation in big-O notation? Write a sentence explaining why. Remember to account for the time complexity of the underlying linked list operations!</p>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
<p>Now we’ll analyze the time complexity of depth first search. Remember that for this class, we aren’t doing formal proofs of time complexity, but we do want to have some justification for the answers.</p>

<p>a. The algorithm given in “Solving the maze” of HW5 is depth first search. Analyze the number of simple operations that are required at each step of that algorithm. You are welcome to copy the steps from the homework description and then put your analysis on each line.</p>

<p>b. Based on your step-by-step analysis, provide a function that describes the time complexity of the algorithm using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">V</code> for the number of maze squares. (You should not need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code>, make sure you know why!) This function should include the constants and coefficients.</p>

<p>c. Identify the asymptotic order of the algorithm (the big-O) by finding a C and n<sub>0</sub> and be sure to show your work.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ll analyze the time complexity of breadth first search.</p>

<p>a. Analyze the number of simple operations that are required for each step of the algorithm that you implemented in the Breadth First Search lab.</p>

<p>b. Provide a function that describes the time complexity of the algorithm using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">V</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code>.</p>

<p>c. Identify the asymptotic order of the algorithm, be sure to show your work as before.</p>

<h2 id="submitting">Submitting</h2>
<p>This activity is not a homework assignment. That means that you’re evaluated on whether you attempted all parts of it, but your work will not be graded for correctness as long as a clear effort has been made. If you aren’t able to complete some parts, great ways to indicate clear effort are to reach out for help before the deadline (note ways you did so in your Collaborations section) and to use comments in the document to indicate things you tried but what went wrong/where you got stuck.</p>

<p>Submit your PDF to Moodle as always.</p>
