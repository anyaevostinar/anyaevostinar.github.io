  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>For this course you are developing a data-driven website using the Flask framework with a team.
This page details the final expectations for your team project and will be added to throughout the term as you construct each of the pieces.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>

<p>You should work with your team on this project.
You are able to get help from outside sources, as specified in the syllabus, but everything that your team submits should be your own.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>

<p>You complete project is due Monday November 20th at 9pm on GitHub.
There are no revisions allowed after this point and no late submissions can be graded per <a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/handbook/academics/?policy_id=21449&amp;a=student">official college policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="your-task">Your Task</h2>
<p>Your overall task is to create a data-driven website using the Flask framework, which you will do throughout the term.
There are several subcomponents, which you will have the opportunity to submit and receive feedback on before the final evaluation at the end of the term.
Each subcomponent is listed below with a link to its page and the final evaluation criteria for it.
To be clear: you are not resubmitting anything for the final deadline, each subcomponent is assessed separately; there is not an additional submission of the entire thing at the end of the term. However, each of your subcomponents will be evaluated in the context of your overall project and so they need to work together.</p>

<h2 id="revising-subcomponents">Revising subcomponents</h2>
<p>You will have submitted the subcomponents, received feedback on them, and submitted revised versions of them by the end of the term.
If your revised versions needed further revision, you may make further revisions before the end of the term.
You may request that a subcomponent revision is evaluated again (after the first round of revision), but I make no guarantee of how soon that will happen. 
Assessment and feedback will be prioritized for the initial submission and first round of revision, and any further revisions may or may not be assessed before the end of the term.
To request assessment of a subcomponent after the first round of revision, [fill out this Revision assessment request form] (Link TBD), which will email me.</p>

<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>
<p>Your project proposal includes the dataset, interesting features, and your team contract.
That will be considered your project description.
See the [Moodle page for the requirements] (link tbd).</p>

<h3 id="command-linecore-functionality">Command line/core functionality</h3>

<p>The <a href="project-command-line">first subcomponent of the project</a> is a command line interface and the core functionality.
Your final version should still support command line functionality even though it will also have a browser-based functionality (this is a common practice to enable more automated interaction with your database).</p>
