    <p>For a few months (ever since I started teaching Intro to CS in Python), I’ve been looking for the easiest way to get brand new students practicing with writing Python as quickly as possible. 
I soon was convinced that being able to run Python code in the browser was what I really wanted (since trying to support all of them getting set up with their own machines takes a while). 
While there are great websites out there that <a href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">let you run Python in the browser</a>, they all require that I send students to that third-party site, which is an extra step that I chafed at. 
I felt like there had to be an easy way to give them a space to try things out right on this website (since I send them here for readings and labs anyway), but I couldn’t find quite what I was looking for.</p>

<p>The fabulous <a href="https://alackles.github.io/">Acacia Ackles</a> has just solved my problem and I’m ecstatic.
<a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a> makes it so blissfully easy to put a Python REPL anywhere that JavaScript is supported, and it’s going to open up a whole world of possibility for next year!</p>

<p>I just had to add one JavaScript include line and now I can do this:</p>

<script defer="" src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>

<p>Try printing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code>:</p>
<py-repl id="my-repl"> 
test=2
print(test)
</py-repl>

<p>That just looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;py-repl id="my-repl"&gt; 
test=2
print(test)
&lt;/py-repl&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Bliss!</p>
