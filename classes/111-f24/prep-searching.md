## Overview
You've frequently used Python's built-in functionality for searching for an item in a list, but how does that actually work? What if the list is already sorted; can you search faster then?
Today's focus will be on two algorithms used for finding an item in unsorted and sorted lists.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the idea of sequential searching
* Explain the high-level idea of binary search

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement sequential search
* Identify the time complexity of sequential searching in the worst case
* Implement recursive binary search
* Identify when to use sequential vs. binary search

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [5.2-5.4](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=967865)
