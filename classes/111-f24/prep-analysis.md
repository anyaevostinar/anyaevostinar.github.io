## Overview
So far in class we've talked generally about some things being *slow* like looking for an item in a list, but we haven't been very precise about what that means.
We want a way to be able to compare between different approaches to solving a problem to see which might be better.
Better can mean a lot of things, but today we're going to focus on how to compare two algorithms based on how *fast* they will solve the same problem using "Big-O" analysis.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what *benchmark analysis* is
* Explain what *Big-O notation* is and why is is needed over benchmark analysis
* Define *best case* and *worse case* at a high-level

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Determine which of the common order of magnitude functions a simple program falls into

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [2.2-2.4](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=911555)
