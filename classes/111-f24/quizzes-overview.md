## Quiz Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the quizzes in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each quiz will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate proficiency/mastery in for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 quizzes.

## Quiz Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will ultimately all be assessed via quizzes are:
1. Using variables
    * Proficiency: create and use several variables
    * Mastery: Draw memory diagram for how variables change
2. Using definite loops
    * Proficiency: Basic loop
    * Mastery: Loop using `range` and indexing
3. Using indefinite loops
    * Proficiency: Basic counter loop
    * Mastery: Loop that stops based on user input
4. Using nested loops
    * Proficiency: Predicting what given nested loop will do
    * Mastery: Writing nested loops
5. Using conditional statements
    * Proficiency: Using basic if/else syntax
    * Mastery: Using three-part conditional
6. Using lists
    * Proficiency: Creating and accessing a list
    * Mastery: Changing values in a list
7. Using return values
    * Proficiency: Using a return statement
    * Mastery: Saving and using returned result
8. Using function parameters
    * Proficiency: Using an immutable parameter
    * Mastery: Mutating a list parameter within a function
9. Using objects
    * Proficiency: Creating instance of an object
    * Mastery: Changing instance through a method
10. Using classes
    * Proficiency: Defining class with constructor
    * Mastery: Defining additional method
11. Using instance variables
    * Proficiency: Accessing instance variables
    * Mastery: Changing instance variables
12. Using recursion
    * Proficiency: Defining the [three laws of recursion](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/Recursion/TheThreeLawsofRecursion.html?mode=browsing)
    * Mastery: Writing a recursive function
13. Debugging syntax errors
    * Proficiency: Identifying and explaining `TypeError`s
    * Mastery: Identifying and explaining scope errors
14. Predicting the behavior of a program
    * Proficiency: Predicting behavior of imperative program with changing variables
    * Mastery: Predicting behavior of functional/object-oriented program
15. Explaining the difference between objects and classes
    * Proficiency: Identifying classes and objects in example code
    * Mastery: Explaining the relationship between objects and classes
16. Explaining sorting algorithms
    * Proficiency: Demonstrate the process of insertion or selection sort
    * Mastery: Demonstrate the process of merge sort
17. Explaining binary search
    * Proficiency: Demonstrate the process of binary search with an off-by-one-error
    * Mastery: Demonstrate the process of binary search without error
18. Identifying worst case efficiency
    * Proficiency: Identify the worst case efficiency of sequential search
    * Mastery: Identify the worst case efficiency of insertion or selection sort
