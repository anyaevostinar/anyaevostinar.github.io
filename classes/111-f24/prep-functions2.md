title: Functions 2 and Indefinite Iteration Preparation
permalink: /classes/111-f24/functions2-prep
---

## Overview
Functions are very powerful, but also have aspects of them that can be particularly confusing. Today we are focusing on a few of these: how returning really works, thinking more about scope, and how functions can impact mutable objects like lists.

We're also revisiting iteration to learn about the `while` loop.

## Basic Learning Objectives:
Before class, you should be able to:
* Write a simple function that *returns* a value
* Define the meaning of *scope* and *local variable*
* Explain how functions can impact *mutable* objects
* Use a `while` loop for indefinite iteration

## Advanced Learning Objectives:
After class, you should be able to:
* Write and use multiple functions that return values to solve a problem
* Use local variables within functions correctly
* Write a function that changes a list without needing to return it

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks [through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=967842):
* Runestone 12.9-12.10
* Runestone 12.12-12.14
* Runestone 14.2-14.3
