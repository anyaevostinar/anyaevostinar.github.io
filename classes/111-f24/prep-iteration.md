## Overview
Being able to specify a certain number of times that you want some code to be executed through *iteration* is a powerful tool in programming.
Today is focused on one form of iteration, a *definite loop*, also called a *for-loop*.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Iterate over a sequence
* Iterate a certain number of times using *range*
* Explain what the *accumulator pattern* is

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Solve a problem using the accumulator pattern
* Traverse a sequence by index
