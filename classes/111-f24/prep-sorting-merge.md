## Overview
You've learned about several O(n<sup>2</sup>) sorting algorithms. However, there are several faster ways to sort a list of items using recursion.
Today's focus will be on one called *merge sort*.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the idea of *divide and conquer* strategies
* Explain the high-level idea and steps of *merge sort*

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain a recursive implementation of merge sort
* Implement merge sort on paper

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
