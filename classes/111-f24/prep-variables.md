## Overview
Variables are a core part of programming and misconceptions about them are a frequent source of bugs for new (and experienced!) programmers.
While you've probably heard the word before, what it means in programming might be subtly different than you expect from other contexts.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:

* Define the term *variable* in a programming context
* Make a new variable using an *assignment statement*
* Use an existing variable
* Change an existing variable
* Choose legal and descriptive names for your variables

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:

* Explain what it means to evaluate a variable and identify when evaluation occurs
* Explain what happens when one variable is assigned the value of another variable 
* Predict what value a variable will have at the end of a program, especially when the program uses and changes multiple variables
* Draw reference diagrams to show what is happening with a variable in a program, especially when the variable is changed
* Use several variables in a program to solve a problem
* Explain the similarities and differences between variables in programming, math, and other contexts
