## Overview
Frequently you want a program to do one thing in one situation and a different thing some other time. The programming structure that allows for this is a *conditional*. Today will be focused on the conditional structures in Python and the necessary *Boolean* values.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:

* Define what *Boolean* values are
* Recognize the `if`/`elif`/`else` syntax for *conditionals*
* Define what the `and`, `or`, and `not` *logical operators* do
* Define what the `in` operator does in the basic case

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should  be able to:

* Use basic, nested, and chained conditionals to solve a problem
* Use logical operators to solve a problem
* Predict what code will do when *short-circuit boolean evaluation* is used

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks through Moodle:
* Runestone [8.1-8.9](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=966851)
