## Overview
There are several building blocks in Python that you'll need for doing pretty much anything: values, operations, and functions.
Today's class is focused on what you can do with these building blocks and how they differ from what you might expect.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Give examples of at least two *values* of different *types* in Python
* Use operations to solve math problems using Python
* Use a built-in/provided function 
* Change the type of a value

## Advanced Learning Objectives

After class, you should be able to:
* Predict what type an expression will result in
* Explain how `int` and `float` values interact
* Use the modulus `%` operator

## Readings
You should complete the following Runestone readings [through this Moodle link](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=899055).

* 2.1-2.6
