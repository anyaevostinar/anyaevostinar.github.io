The definition of sustainability for this class is broader than you might think. There are 17 total [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) that encompass everything from clean energy to peace to gender equality to decent work for all. This page is a catch-all for various links to inspire and guide you.

Reminder, [here is the library guide](https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/cs257) for the course.
