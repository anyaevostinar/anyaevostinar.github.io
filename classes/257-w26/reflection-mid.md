## Overview
Part of the goal of the course is to regularly reflect on the software development process and your team's functioning. 
The goal of this midterm reflection is that you reflect critically on: the role you are playing in the success of your project team, the ways in which your team is collaborating, and the software development process itself. 

## Due Date
Your reflection is due to the form by 10pm on February 6th.

## Submitting
Fill out the [form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4TA2m2ki8xgKRU97jWhaJAAcaO2V7ZpLJK_-LlFeSuUQN4w/viewform?usp=publish-editor). It should take you **30 minutes** or more. Do not rush through this form, remember that it counts as one of your individual deliverable assignments for the course and I may ask you to revise if your answers are not complete.

## Evaluation
**Core** for this deliverable requires:
* You submit complete answers to each question
* At least one person on your team reviews your overall contribution to the project as equal to other teammates

**Advanced** for this deliverable requires:
* At least two people on your team reviews your overall contribution to the project as equal to other teammates

Note: if there isn't sufficient information from the team reviews, I will rely on other metrics to determine contribution, such as commit history.
