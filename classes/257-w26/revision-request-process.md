## Overview
As stated on the [syllabus](syllabus), you have the chance to revise both team and individual deliverables as many times as you want during the term (sort of). 
However, to keep things organized and manageable, there is a process that you need to go through that is detailed here.

## First Revision
The first revision on each deliverable is due a week after the initial submission assessment is released and will generally be assessed fairly soon after the due date.

## Subsequent Revisions
If you wish to revise after you get the feedback from the first revision, you can do so by following these steps:
1. Read the feedback and correct your deliverable
2. Submit your corrected homework to the same Github repo
3. Submit a request on [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_ZXCGbvdLuhNLpkkX81Jyx8D7jv6Hm2OxLCndwyi5HuL0jA/viewform?usp=publish-editor)
4. Wait for the revision to be assessed, which might take until the end of term, or might happen more quickly than that (but you should assume it will be the end of term!)
5. Repeat from step 1 if you want

**You must submit a request through the form; your submission will not automatically be reassessed!**
Remember that you can only submit 1 subsequent revision per week, so you should make it count.
