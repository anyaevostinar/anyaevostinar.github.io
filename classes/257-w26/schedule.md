[Syllabus](syllabus)

This is a rough schedule of topics for each week and the expected completion of assignments.
It will continue to be filled in throughout the term.  
Many of the links will be dead-ends until closer to the relevant date.

**Class topics and homework information may change over the course of the term.** Please treat this schedule as a rough guide for seeing what we'll be focusing on, and expect that there will be shifts as the term progresses.

Readings should be completed **before** the class day that they are listed. Class is structured expecting that you have completed the reading. You also will need to complete a preparation activity before class, which you'll find on Moodle.

"Krug" refers to our textbook **Don't Make Me Think! Revisited, by Steve Krug**.
"Martin" refers to our textbook **Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin**.
Other readings will be linked through Moodle.

The slide links are all restricted to Carleton folks, so make sure you're logged in to your Carleton account if you have one. If you are outside of Carleton and would like to see them, just shoot me an email!
