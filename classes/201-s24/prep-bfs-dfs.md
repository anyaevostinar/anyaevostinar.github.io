## Overview
There are many different ways that you can use graphs to solve problems, but two of the main algorithms are focused on how you search through the graph: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Today we'll consider these two algorithms and their time complexities.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of breadth- and depth-first search
* Explain the time complexity of both algorithms

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement breadth- and depth-first search
* Demonstrate the time complexity of both

## Reading
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
