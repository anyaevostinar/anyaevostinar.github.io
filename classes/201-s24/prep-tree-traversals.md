## Overview
An interesting thing about trees is that the order in which you go through the nodes, *traversing*, can greatly change based on what you are trying to accomplish. Today, we'll learn about the three ways of traversing a tree and think about several specific tree implementations.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what the three tree traversals are

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a specific kind of tree to solve a given problem

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks [through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=910114):
* Runestone 6.7-6.8
