## Learning Objectives

The  [learning objectives](quizzes-overview) that you can demonstrate your proficiency/mastery on for quiz 10 are:

1. Defining variables with appropriate type in Java
    a. Proficiency - basic types, M - Collections with generics
2. Writing loops (definite and indefinite) in Java
    a. Proficiency - basic loops, M - Nested loops
4. Defining methods in Java
    a. Proficiency - method without parameters/return value, M - parameters and return value
5. Instantiating and using objects in Java
    a. Proficiency - using without parameters/return value, M - using method with parameters and return value
6. Using interfaces
    a. Proficiency - implement a specified interface, M - define your own interface
7. Using inheritance
    a. Proficiency - simple subclass, M - use call to super to build on super's method
8. Using linked lists
9. Explaining time complexity of linked list operations
    a. Proficiency - define Big-O of specified operation, M - demonstrate how you get that Big-O
11. Explaining time complexity of stack operations

22. Demonstrating depth-first search
    a. Proficiency - indicate first sequence of DFS, M - demonstrate full DFS
23. Demonstrating hash tables
24. Explaining time complexity of hashing
    a. Proficiency - define Big-O in worst case, M - explain how you get that Big-O

You are not allowed to bring anything to the self-scheduled final, so instead you should fill out the [checklist form linked on Moodle](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCXloRKJrImuJ7hzNGtCYH1KB2jYU_keQQ5BgceuD9RkuLwA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and I will include your checklist in your exam booklet.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Go back and re-solve the problems from previous quizzes
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
