## Overview
We will be dealing with a lot of *collections* in this class, like lists, which need to store objects of any particular type. Since Java is particular about the type of objects, we will need to use a concept called a *generic* to define our own collections and work with the Java built-in collections. Today's class is focused on diving into that weird `<>` syntax that you've been seeing and exploring the idea of generics.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain why generics are necessary in Java
* Explain what a `HashMap` is and what it can be used for

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Write a container class using a generic
* Use Java built-in container classes with generics
* Use `HashMap` to solve a problem


## Readings
You should read the following from the book Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Java:

* [1.9 Collections and Wrapper Classes](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/javads/introduction_collections-and-wrappers.html?mode=browsing)
* [A.5 Java Generics](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/javads/oop_generics.html?mode=browsing)
