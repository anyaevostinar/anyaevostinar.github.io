## Overview
You've used the `HashMap` built-in data structure, and possibly a dictionary in Python, but how do these actually work? Today we'll be focusing on that magic that is hashing that leads to such amazing performance for hashmaps and dictionaries.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of hashing
* Give an example hash function for integers and strings
* Explain why collision resolution is necessary

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own simple hash table

## Reading
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [5.5](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=940758)
