## Overview
We will finally move away from linear structures and start thinking about ways of storing data that have more complicated connections. Today we'll focus on a group of structures referred to as *trees* due to their ability to branch.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what the tree ADT is
* Explain how a tree data structure can be implemented
* Explain what a *binary search tree* is

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a binary search tree

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks [through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=909966):
* Runestone 6.2-6.4
