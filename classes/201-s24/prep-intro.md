## Overview
Welcome to Data Structures!
Every class day, there will be a prep page like this that will detail what you should **do** and **understand** *before* class time, as well as what you should do and understand during and after class on the topic.
Today's objective are mostly about the class structure itself, because it's a little different than you might be used to.

You should always aim to be **proficient** in the *basic learning objectives* before class by going through the readings and videos and completing the specified exercises (and reach out for help ahead of time if you need).

## Basic Learning Objectives
These are the learning objectives that each student is responsible for demonstrating proficiency at **BEFORE** the class meeting (though if you are adding late or don't have a chance to do them before class, just do them as soon as you can!). 
Sometimes, you will demonstrate this proficiency by completing embedded questions in the readings, and submitting answers on Moodle.
Today, you will just fill out a background survey and post to the class discussion forum.
If you are having trouble doing so, you should reach out for help before class if you can.

Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain how this class' grading structure differs from most
* Explain what kinds of collaboration are and aren't allowed
* Explain the overall timeline of when assignments are due and when quizzes occur

## Advanced Learning Objectives
The following objectives should  be mastered by each student during and following our class session through our in-class work:

You should be able to:
* Explain how quizzes and homework assessment leads to your final grade
* Explain what *data structures* are
* Identify how to write basic Java using a reference sheet

## Readings
You should read each of the following:

* [Syllabus](syllabus)
* [Schedule](schedule)
* [Collaboration Policy](collaboration)

## Checks
You should do these checks on Moodle:
* Join CampusWire and post an introduction in "General" with the following:
    * Your preferred name and optionally your pronouns
    * Your class year
    * Why you decided to take this class/what you're hoping to get out of this class
    * One hobby/thing you like to do for fun
* Complete the background survey
