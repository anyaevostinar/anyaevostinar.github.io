You may print out and bring with you a copy of [this checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iBYzuF_wVHefPmjX5TGET-gnEpiCUSV_A9kYhogr-zM/edit?usp=sharing) to help you keep track of the learning objectives that you are still working on during the quiz.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Go back and re-solve the problems from previous quizzes
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
