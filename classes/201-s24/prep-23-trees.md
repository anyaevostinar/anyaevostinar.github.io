## Overview
The main issue with binary search trees is that they have to be relatively balanced to maintain their efficient time complexity and keeping them balanced can be complicated. There are many solutions to this issue, but one of them is to break away from the limitation of a binary tree and instead have nodes with more flexibility: the 2-3 tree.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what nodes in a 2-3 tree consist of
* Explain at a high-level how values are added to a 2-3 tree

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a basic 2-3 tree

## Resources
You should read the following:
