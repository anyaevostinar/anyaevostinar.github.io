## Goals
To get a good start on the final project by thinking of several possible projects that would satisfy the requirements.

## Setup

a. If you haven't already, read through the [final project page](final-project). If you read it previously, still open it up to reference.

b. Create a Google Doc and share it with your partner (if you have one) to record your initial planning today.

c. Even if you have an idea already, it's good to come up with at least one alternative, so create two headers in your document:
* Main Idea
* Alternatives

## Exercise 1
In the "Main Idea" section of your document, write down your main idea/the idea you are most excited about and how it will meet the requirements. Specify:
* Is it a game or simulation?
* What is the basic idea of the game or simulation? (One sentence/name is good)
* What the superclass would be 
    * What methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be
    * What methods/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other **two** class concepts you would use for the implementation (from the list on the [project page](final-project)!)

## Exercise 2
In the "Alternatives" section of your document, come up with **two ideas (or more!)** that would also possibly work for the final project, but perhaps you haven't thought it out as much or aren't quite as excited (or maybe you are equally excited and can't decide, that's good too!). 

Specify for each:
* Is it a game or simulation?
* What is the basic idea of the game or simulation? (One sentence/name is good)
* What ideas do you have for the superclass and subclasses?
* What are possible other class concepts you would use for the implementation (from the list on the [project page](final-project)!)

Discuss with a group near you what ideas you've each come up with (don't worry if there is overlap, that's fine! Everyone can do a chess game if they want). Pay special attention to if the inheritance is meaningful and help the other group if you have ideas for them.

## Exercise 3
Make sure you have the inheritance clearly planned out for one of the ideas and mark it. You'll share at the end of class about the plan for the inheritance. Then get started on the project proposal (submission link on Moodle) and your [minimum viable product](project-checkin).
