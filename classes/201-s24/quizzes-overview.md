## Quiz Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the quizzes in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each quiz will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate proficiency/mastery in for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 quizzes.

## Quiz Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will ultimately all be assessed via quizzes are:
1. Defining variables with appropriate type in Java
2. Writing loops (definite and indefinite) in Java
3. Writing conditional statements in Java
4. Defining methods in Java
5. Instantiating and using objects in Java
6. Using interfaces
7. Using inheritance
8. Using linked lists
9. Explaining time complexity of linked list operations
10. Using stacks
11. Explaining time complexity of stack operations
12. Using queues
13. Explaining time complexity of queue operations
14. Explaining quicksort
15. Explaining time complexity of quicksort
16. Using recursion
17. Using balanced search trees
18. Using heaps
19. Explaining time complexity of heapsort
20. Demonstrating breadth-first search
21. Explaining time complexity of breadth-first search
22. Demonstrating depth-first search
23. Demonstrating hash tables
24. Explaining time complexity of hashing

You can see how you are doing on each of these on Moodle under the "Grades" tab.
