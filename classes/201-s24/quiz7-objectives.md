19. **Explaining time complexity of heapsort**
    a. Proficiency - define Big-O in worst case, M - demonstrate how you get that Big-O
20. **Demonstrating breadth-first search**
    a. Proficiency - indicate first level of BFS, M - demonstrate full BFS
21. **Explaining time complexity of breadth-first search**
    a. Proficiency - define Big-O in worst case in terms of just V, M - demonstrate how you get that Big-O
22. **Demonstrating depth-first search**
    a. Proficiency - indicate first sequence of DFS, M - demonstrate full DFS
17. Using balanced search trees
    a. Proficiency - demonstrate adding in basic case to 2-3 tree, M - demonstrate adding that requires splitting and promotion

## Suggestions
Remember that this isn't your only chance to demonstrate your understanding of these learning objectives, so try not to stress too much.
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the quiz objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
