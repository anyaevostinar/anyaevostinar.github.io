## Overview
You've worked with lists a lot by using built-in functionality, but how do those built-in lists actually work? Today, we'll be focusing on one way to implement the unordered list ADT: linked lists.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain what a list is
* Explain what the unordered list ADT is
* Explain the general idea of a linked list


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a basic linked list in Java


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=934952):

* Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Java 3.2, 3.19-3.21

## Checks
No additional checks.
