## Overview
We've been using the `ArrayList` data structure a lot and it's time to dig into what is underlying this structure and how its efficiency is impacted. Today we'll officially learn about Java `array`s and how they work.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Initialize a new array
* Explain at a high level how an array differs from a linked list

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the worst-case efficiency of adding to an array
* Implement your own array
* Explain the pros and cons of array-based and linked-based structures


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=908512):
