## Overview
Java is a classic example of an '**o**bject-**o**riented **p**rogramming' language. You used some objects before, but Java forces you to really get into objects. Today, we'll focus on the concepts core to "OOP", which you'll use heavily in Java but apply across lots of other programming languages.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Define *constructor* and *inheritance*
* Be able to define your own class in Java with instance methods
* Explain how *object* and *instance* relate to each other in programming

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Create a subclass
* Work with multiple related classes
* Explain how instance variables work with inheritance


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=922931) in Intro Java for Python Programmers:

* 1.8 up to 1.8.3.1 (The `Object` Class)

## Checks
You should complete the reading checks embedded in the reading assignment on Moodle.
