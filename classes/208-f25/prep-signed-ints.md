## Overview
You may have noticed that we've been focused on only positive numbers so far. It turns out that negative numbers are important too, but there is some nuance to how they should be represented.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should  be able to:
* Explain the idea of signed magnitude
* Explain the problem with signed magnitude


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Demonstrate the process of negation with two's complement
* Explain the difference between logical and arithmetic right shifts



## Resources
You should read the following in DIS: 
* [4.3 Signed Binary Integers](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/signed.html)


## Checks
Practice calculating 2's complement by hand on paper (as you will need to for exams) and submit the 2's complement negations of the following to Moodle:
* `00001101`
* `11010010`
* `01001000`
