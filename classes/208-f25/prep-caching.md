## Overview
We'll now turn our attention to how data is actually stored in memory and, in particular, how it is moved and cached to improve performance of a program.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the tradeoffs of different kinds of memory
* Explain how a direct-mapped cache works

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Identify if a given cache is direct-mapped, fully associative, or set associative
* Interpret given cache parameters to identify where data is stored

## Resources
Read the following:
* [DIS 11.1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/mem_hierarchy.html)
* [DIS 11.2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/devices.html)
* [DIS 11.4](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/caching.html)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* What are the primary storage devices of a typical computer ordered by capacity?
* What are the pros and cons of a direct-mapped cache design?
