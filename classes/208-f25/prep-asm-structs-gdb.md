## Overview
We're continuing our journey through assembly with some more complex elements, including thinking more about condition codes, arrays, and structs!

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Identify when each condition code would be set to 1
* Explain how arrays and structs show up in assembly

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Predict the result of assembly code using condition codes
* Interpret assembly code that uses structs and arrays

## Resources
Read the following:
* [DIS 7.4.1 Condition Codes](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/preliminaries.html#_preliminaries) - review the section on Condition Codes
* [DIS 7.7 Arrays in Assembly](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/arrays.html)
* [DIS 7.9 Structs in Assembly](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/structs.html)

## Checks
Submit one to two sentences to the following question:
* If you were looking at assembly code (like when trying to escape a zoo for example), how could you tell if you were working with an array or a struct?
