You will be allowed to bring [your checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HaqG8Pgep0ZP7_FAvRT-354Mq3HxXsUSIjUOLqgBSYM/edit?usp=sharing) with you but there should be no writing on it other than your name and you will submit it with your exam. If you have lost your original copy, you can print out a new **stapled** copy to bring.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish any reading checks/labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the exam objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
