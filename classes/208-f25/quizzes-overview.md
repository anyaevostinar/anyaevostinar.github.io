## Exam Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the exams in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each exam will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate your understanding of for that quiz, and most learning objectives will appear on at least 2 exams.

## Exam Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will be on exams are:

### Number representations

#### Core
* NR1: Converting from unsigned binary to decimal
* NR2: Negating a binary value with 2's complement

#### Advanced
* NR3-AD: Adding/Subtracting two hexadecimal numbers

### Data representations

#### Core
* DR1: Demonstrate how a struct is stored in memory with arrays (no buffer bytes)
* DR2: Encode a codepoint (given the byte count) (with table provided)
* DR3: Explain how bytes are interpreted with `%c` and `%d`
* DR4: Demonstrate how an integer is stored in big- and little-endian
* DR5: Demonstrate the use of `\0` to null-terminate a string
* DR6: Demonstrate the difference between a value and its address

#### Advanced
* DR7-AD: Demonstrate how complex elements (e.g. structs with nested arrays) of an array are stored in memory
* DR8-AD: Decode a multi-character encoded byte seqeuence (any byte count) (with table provided)



### Operators

#### Core
* OP1: Perform a given bitwise/logical operation
* OP2: Perform a given logical shift operation
* OP3: Identify when overflow will occur in addition
* OP4: Use addresses of members of a struct or elements in a `char` array correctly

#### Advanced
* OP5-AD: Provide bitwise/logical operations for a given affect (e.g. via masking)
* OP6-AD: Resize an integer value to a larger size (signed or unsigned)
* OP7-AD: Demonstrate the correct use of `&` and `*` operators

### Assembly Instructions

#### Core
* AI1: Interpret operands with constants, registers, and basic memory lookups
* AI2: Interpret a basic arithmetic instruction
* AI3: Interpret instructions using pointer arithmetic
* AI4: Determine the outcome of a cmp jump sequence

#### Advanced
* AI5-AD: Interpret operands with offsets, indexing, and scaling
* AI6-AD: Interpret `mov` instructions
* AI7-AD: Draw the stack given push/pop/add/sub instruction(s)


### Assembly code

#### Core
* AC1: Distinguish between recursion/looping/branching
* AC2: Identify parameter count/types and return type of given a given assembly program

#### Advanced
* AC3-AD: Describe the functionality of a given assembly program
* AC4-AD: Reconstruct all of a C program from given assembly

### Security

#### Core
* SEC1: Provide a high-level explanation of the trusting-trust attack
* SEC2: Provide a high-level explanation of buffer-overflow attack and defense

### Networking

#### Core
* NW1: Provide a high-level explanation of DNS

### Operating Systems

#### Core
* OS1: Provide a relative path for a given file system structure

#### Advanced
* OS2-AD: Interpret programs with multiple fork calls

### Memory Hierarchies

#### Core
* MH1: Interpret given cache parameters

#### Advanced
* MH2-AD: Explain the performance implications of loop ordering

You can see how you are doing on each of these on Moodle under the "Grades" tab.
