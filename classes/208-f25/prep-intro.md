## Overview
Welcome to Intro to Systems!
Every class day, there will be a prep page like this that will detail what you should **do** and **understand** *before* class time, as well as what you should do and understand during and after class on the topic.
Today's objectives are mostly about the class structure itself, because it's a little different than you might be used to.

You should always aim to be **proficient** in the *basic learning objectives* before class by going through the readings and videos and completing the specified exercises (and reach out for help ahead of time if you need). You should submit your solutions to the check questions via the link through Moodle for **engagement credits** (the syllabus will explain).

## Basic Learning Objectives
These are the learning objectives that each student is responsible for practicing **BEFORE** the class meeting (though if you are adding late or don't have a chance to do them before class, just do them as soon as you can!). 
Usually, you will do this by submitting answers via the link on Moodle.
Today, you will fill out a background survey and answer some check questions.
If you are having trouble doing so, you should reach out for help before class if you can.

You should be able to: 
* Explain how this class' grading structure differs from most
* Be setup to connect to `mantis`, where you'll be doing much of your work this term

## Advanced Learning Objectives
You will practice the following objectives during and following our class session through our in-class work:

After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the course policies on AI and collaboration
* Write and run a basic C program
* Navigate the course website and resources
* Work with bitwise operators and binary
