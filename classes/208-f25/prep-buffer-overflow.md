## Overview
Early on, we discussed the difference between `strcpy` and `strncpy`, including the safety implications of copying an unspecified amount from a buffer. We now have enough knowledge of assembly to understanding how buffer overflow can occur and prepare to do your own buffer overflow attacks.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define "buffer" in this context
* Explain the high level idea of a buffer overflow attack

## Advanced Learning Objectives
* Execute your own buffer overflow attack

## Resources
Read the following:
* [DIS 7.10](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html)

## Checks
Write 3-4 sentences explaining the high level idea of a buffer overflow attack.
