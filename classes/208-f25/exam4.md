## Learning Objectives

The subset of [learning objectives](exams-overview) that you can demonstrate your understanding on for Exam 4 are:

New:
* SEC2: Provide a high-level explanation of buffer-overflow attack and defense
* OS1: Provide a relative path for a given file system structure
* OS2-AD: Interpret programs with multiple fork calls
* MH1: Interpret given cache parameters

Retake:
* AI7-AD: Draw the stack given push/pop/add/sub instruction(s)
* SEC1: Provide a high-level explanation of the trusting-trust attack

* OP3: Identify when overflow will occur in addition
* OP4: Use addresses of members of a struct or elements in a `char` array correctly
* OP6-AD: Resize a value to a larger size (signed or unsigned)
* OP7-AD: Demonstrate the correct use of `&` and `*` operators

* AI1: Interpret operands with constants, registers, and basic memory lookups
* AI2: Interpret a basic arithmetic instruction
* AI3: Interpret instructions using pointer arithmetic
* AI4: Determine the outcome of a `cmp` jump sequence
* AI5-AD: Interpret operands with offsets, indexing, and scaling
* AI6-AD: Interpret `mov` instructions

* AC1: Distinguish between recursion/looping/branching
* AC2: Identify parameter count/types and return type of a given assembly program
* AC3-AD: Describe the functionality of a given assembly program
* AC4-AD: Reconstruct all of a C program from given assembly

* DR1: Demonstrate how a struct is stored in memory with arrays (no buffer bytes)
* DR6: Demonstrate the difference between a value and its address
* DR7-AD: Demonstrate how complex elements (e.g. structs with nested arrays) of an array are stored in memory

You will be allowed to bring [your checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HaqG8Pgep0ZP7_FAvRT-354Mq3HxXsUSIjUOLqgBSYM/edit?usp=sharing) with you but there should be no writing on it other than your name and you will submit it with your exam. I'll return them after the exam.  If you have lost your original copy, you can print out a new **stapled** copy to bring.

## Suggestions
Remember that this isn't your only chance to demonstrate your understanding of these learning objectives, so try not to stress too much.
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish any reading checks/labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the exam objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
