I will include a copy of your responses to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKB18OEJcm0Lo9X05_cKeOTx4ReIYUhQwf4pJrIDD0med91g/viewform?usp=dialog) in your self-scheduled final packet.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish HW8 and make sure that it works, since otherwise it is unlikely you will be able to accurately answer the exam questions (note that the autograder will be closed, so you'll have to test it yourself)
* Finish any reading checks/labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the exam objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
