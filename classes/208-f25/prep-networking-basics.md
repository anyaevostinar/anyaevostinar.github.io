## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high level difference between UDP and TCP
* Explain why packet loss is inevitable

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a basic socket-based client

## Resources
Read the following:
* Sec 48.1-48.3 of [OSTEP: Networking Basics](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dist-intro.pdf)

## Checks
Submit to Moodle answers to the following (they aren't very exciting, sorry):
* Why is packet loss inevitable?
* How does UDP deal with packet loss?
* How does TCP deal with packet loss?
