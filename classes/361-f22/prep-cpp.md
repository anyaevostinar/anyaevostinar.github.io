## Overview
We'll be using C++ in this class for the most part.
The syntax is fairly similar to Java (which you're hopefully familiar with), with a couple of complications.
If you've learned about C, that's great, and a lot of that knowledge will transfer.
If you haven't, don't worry, I'm only assuming knowledge of Java.
If you are more comfortable with Python than Java, I've also included a resource aimed at transitioning to C++ from Python, though it is a bigger jump.

The main difference with C++ is needing to manage your own memory, so the learning objectives and resources for today are focused on getting an understanding of that.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the basic idea of a *pointer* in C++
* Write a snippet of code that gets the address of a variable
* Write a snippet of code that dereferences a pointer

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Solve basic programming problems in C++ that use pointers
* Explain how C++ uses `&` and `*`

## Resources
The following are resources that I think will help you achieve the basic learning objectives; you may only need one of them or all three.

* [Java vs C++ Cheatsheet](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/java/syntax-differences-java-c++.html) - Don't worry about things that don't sound familiar from Java, just a resource for translating what you know in Java to C++
* [Video on C++ Pointers and References](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvUYbUn9uQ4) - I recommend watching up to the Arrays of Pointers section
* [Python to C++ Book Pointers](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/cpp4python/AtomicData/AtomicData.html?mode=browsing#pointers&mode=browsing) - you might find it helpful to read more of this book, but the Pointers section will be particularly relevant
