## Overview
We'll now be shifting focus to how artificial life can be used to study *groups of organisms* interacting in the subfield of *artificial ecology*. 
Today will be focused on getting familiar with some of the vocabulary and classic results in this field, so you are ready to build on it.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define what *ecosystem* means
* Explain the idea of the *Daisyworld model*
* Explain the idea of *Lotka-Volterra equations*
* Explain how *individual-based/agent-based models* differ from equation-based models

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use Empirical's `World` class to create a basic predator-prey individual-based model

## Resources
You should read the following:
* 7.1 of [Biological Bits](https://users.monash.edu/~aland/BiologicalBits.html) - this is a very short free textbook; if you have Apple devices, you can get the iBook free, otherwise the PDF is linked on the page as well through ResearchGate.
