## Goals
To get started coding in C++ based on your Java knowledge.

## Setup
Go to [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and create a Developers account if you don't already have one (you don't need to use your real name if you don't want to!).

Reference this [cheat sheet](/classes/361-w21/ref_pointer_ref) for the code from the video.

## Exercises
Complete each of the following HackerRank exercises.

* [Solve Me First](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/solve-me-first/problem) (Make sure your language is set to C++14)
* [Input and Output](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-input-and-output/problem)
* [Pointer](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-tutorial-pointer/problem) (you will need the `<cmath>` library and `abs()` function)
* [Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-introduction/problem)


## Extra
If you have extra time, you are encouraged to try out other HackerRank C++ activities to get more practice. We'll continue to check in on C++ in the coming weeks, so getting more practice will be helpful.
