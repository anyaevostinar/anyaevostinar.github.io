## Overview
The final major area we'll discuss is *digital evolution*.
Because evolution is an algorithm that can occur whenever its required components are in place, we can create actual evolving systems digitally.
Today will be focused on some background about this area and one particular system, Avida.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* List the requirements for evolution by natural selection
* Explain at a high-level what the Avida system is

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement the components necessary for a simple digital evolution system using Empirical

## Resources
You should watch/read the Overview section of the [Digital Evolution](https://alife.org/encyclopedia/digital-evolution/introduction-to-digital-evolution/) on the Encyclopedia of Artificial Life.
The first video is most important, the second video is an extended version if you are interested.

## Optional Resources
Optionally, you can also read any of the following for more detail and background.
In particular, many of these resources are good places to look for contributions that you could make for your encyclopedia assignment.
* Complexity Ch 8 "Self-Reproduction in Computers"
* 7.2 and 7.3 of [Biological Bits](https://users.monash.edu/~aland/BiologicalBits.html) - this is a very short free textbook; if you have Apple devices, you can get the iBook free, otherwise the PDF is linked on the page as well through ResearchGate.
