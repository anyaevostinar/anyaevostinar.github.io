## Overview
Putting evolution by natural selection into a computer is surprisingly easy to do and a good way to start thinking about how artificial systems can demonstrate the dynamics of living systems.
You'll start by learning about one approach to this technique, *genetic algorithms*, also referred to as evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class you should be able to:
* List the inputs and steps of a genetic algorithm
* Provide one example of how genetic algorithms have been used in the real world

## Advanced Learning Objectives

After class, you should be able to:
* Write a genetic algorithm program to solve a simple problem

## Reading
* Complexity Ch 9 (you might not need to read the entire example)

## Checks
Answer the following questions on Moodle:
* What are the inputs and steps of a genetic algorithm?
* What is one example of how a genetic algorithm has been used in the real world?
