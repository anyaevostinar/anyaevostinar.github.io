## Overview
While we're generally focused in this class on making GUIs for artificial life software, sometimes you'll also want to collect data more efficiently with your projects.
Today's focus will be on using Empirical's data monitoring tools to output data into files in your native version of your project.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class you should be able to:
* Explain what Empirical's `DataNode` and `DataMonitor` do
* List the types of data that Empirical provides tools to record

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Using Empirical's data collection tools to record data to files in your own project
