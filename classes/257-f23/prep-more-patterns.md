## Overview
There are three design patterns that you've likely used and will find useful, so we're going to focus on those today.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define what the Observer, Iterator, and Decorator design patterns are

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement these three patterns in Python
* Explain how code smells, class design principles, and design patterns reinforce each other or possibly conflict

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, read the following:
* [Observer Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) - skip the pseudocode, look at the [Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/python/example) example if you want
* [Iterator Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator) - ditto, [Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator/python/example) example
* [Decorator Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator) - ditto, [Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator/python/example) example

## Checks
Complete the prep check on Moodle.
