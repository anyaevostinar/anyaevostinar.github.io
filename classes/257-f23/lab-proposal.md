## Goal
To get a good start on your project proposal by thinking about your team contract and potential datasets.

## Team Contract
1. Make a Google doc to record notes
2. Discuss with your team your answers to the reading questions related to the team contract and start working on [answering the questions in the prompt](project-proposal).

## Datasets
1. Make a copy of the [Dataset Records Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RyhW9aWnEtCwN0zFL_SjW5bUd44TcVzSJDZwez-Arw/copy) for your team
2. Using our [course research guide](https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/cs257) as a starting point, work with your team to identify potential datasets.
3. Once you've found a dataset, fill in the Dataset Records with your team (there are sections that might not be relevant to you, and it's okay to leave those blank, but make sure to record the URL, date downloaded, authorship, exact name and version, terms of use, and suggested citation since you'll need to turn those in later).
4. Make sure at least one member of your team downloads a copy of the data! If the dataset is small enough, add it to your team GitHub repository in the Data folder.
