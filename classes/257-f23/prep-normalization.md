## Overview
There are a lot of levels of organization to think about with large dataset and databases. We aren't going to dive too deeply (since it's a deep rabbit hole), but today we're going to learn a bit about *database normalization* and how we can better organize our tables within a database.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Define database normalization
* Give an example of first normal form and second normal form

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the trade-offs that should be considered when deciding how to structure database tables
* Explain why database normalization is important


## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you should read at least one of the following:
* [Normalization in database (with example)](https://blog.udemy.com/normalization-in-database-with-example/), from Udemy
* [Normalization of database](https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/database-normalization.php), from Study Tonight

NOTE: You do not need to know the finer details of first normal form vs. fourth normal form, etc. Read these to get a sense of the ways you could, and should, be cutting down on redundancy and inefficiencies in database tables.

## Checks
Write down your answer to the following and bring it to class:
* Give an example from your team project where using one of the normal forms would be useful for organizing your data (i.e. describe the schema and how a specific normal form could be used to benefit your organization).
