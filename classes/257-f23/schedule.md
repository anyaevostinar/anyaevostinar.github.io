title: CS 257 Software Design F23 Schedule
permalink: /classes/257-f23/schedule
---

This is a rough schedule of topics for each week and the expected completion of assignments.
It will continue to be filled in throughout the term.  
Many of the links will be dead-ends until closer to the relevant date.

**Class topics and homework information may change over the course of the term.** Please treat this schedule as a rough guide for seeing what we'll be focusing on, and expect that there will be shifts as the term progresses.

Readings should be completed **before** the class day that they are listed. Class is structured expecting that you have completed the reading. You also will need to complete a preparation activity before class, which you'll find on Moodle.

"Krug" refers to our textbook **Don't Make Me Think! Revisited, by Steve Krug**.
"Martin" refers to our textbook **Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin**.
Other readings will be linked through Moodle.
