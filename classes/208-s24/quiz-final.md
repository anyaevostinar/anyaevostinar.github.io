* Identifying core assembly structures (such as loop vs recursion vs conditional etc)
* Explaining high-level functionality of given assembly (similar to HW6.1)

You will not be able to bring a checklist. Instead, you should make sure to [fill out the form linked on Moodle](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqhyrmmyIKrfwADXrenyrb7-xXJjio7VlZoeLVuqA6VeKEgg/viewform?usp=sf_link) by May 29th at 10pm and I will include your checklist in your exam for you.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Re-solve questions from previous quizzes
* Finish any reading checks/labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the quiz objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
