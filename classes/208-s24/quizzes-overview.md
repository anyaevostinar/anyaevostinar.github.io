## Quiz Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the quizzes in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each quiz will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate proficiency/mastery in for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 quizzes.

## Quiz Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that have appeared on quizzes will be listed here.

You can see how you are doing on each of these on Moodle under the "Grades" tab.
I will continue to update this page throughout the term.
