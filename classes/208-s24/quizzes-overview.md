## Quiz Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the quizzes in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each quiz will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate proficiency/mastery in for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 quizzes.
