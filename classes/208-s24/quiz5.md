You can print and bring [this checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_khtfHhAueQUPa_w-DuRorX1d6PV-MpYI0KoVondkPI/edit?usp=sharing) with you to help you keep track of which learning objectives you are aiming for on this quiz.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Re-solve questions from previous quizzes
* Finish any reading checks/labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the quiz objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
