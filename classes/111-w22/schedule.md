title: CS111 Introduction to Computer Science W22 Schedule
permalink: /classes/111-w22/schedule
---

This is a rough schedule of topics for each day and the release and due dates for each homework assignment.  

**Class topics and homework information may change over the course of the term.** Please treat this schedule as a rough guide for seeing what we'll be focusing on, and expect that there will be shifts as the term progresses.

Readings should be completed **before** the class day that they are listed. Class is structured expecting that you have completed the reading. You also will need to respond to a reading prompt on Slack before class.

"Zelle" refers to our textbook, **Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, 3rd edition, by John Zelle**.
