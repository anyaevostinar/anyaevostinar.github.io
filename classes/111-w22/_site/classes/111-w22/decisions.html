<p>This is a lab assignment and so you will not be submitting it.
However, the concepts and practice will help you on both the homework and exams so I encourage you to make a serious effort on it during class and consider finishing it outside of class.</p>

<p>I recommend making a folder for today’s lab in COURSES as you usually do.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>

<p>Say the policy for speeding tickets in Northfield is $50, plus $5 for each mph over the limit, plus an extra penalty of $200 for any speed over 90 mph.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speeding.py</code> containing a program that accepts a speed limit and a clocked speed and either prints a message indicating that the speed was legal or prints the amount of the fine if the speed was illegal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to see if your program works, come up with a list of test inputs that account the variety of different values a user might provide. In the comments at the top of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speeding.py</code>, list these input values and the result that gets printed to the screen.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
<p>A formula for computing Easter in the years 1982–2048, inclusive, is as follows. Let:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a = year % 19</li>
  <li>b = year % 4</li>
  <li>c = year % 7</li>
  <li>d = (19a + 24) % 30</li>
  <li>e = (2b + 4c + 6d + 5) % 7</li>
</ul>

<p>The date of Easter is March 22 + d + e (which could be in April).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easter.py</code> that inputs a year, verifies it is in the proper range, and then prints out the date of Easter that year.</li>
  <li>The above formula works for every year inside the range 1900-2099 except for 1954, 1981, 2049, and 2076. For these four years, it produces a date that is one week too late. Modify your program to work for the entire range 1900-2099.</li>
  <li>Identify a list of test inputs for your program to verify that it works for the variety of values that a user might provide. In the comments of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easter.py</code>, list these input values and the results that get printed to the screen.</li>
  <li>You may have ended up with a lot of repeated code in the process of making modifications. It’s always good to ‘refactor’ your code after you complete a first draft by going and trying to streamline and improve it. See what repeated code you can streamline, if any.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h2>
<p>In a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">validDate.py</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write a program that accepts a date in the form of a month, a day, and a year, and outputs whether or not the date is valid. For example, 5/24/1988 is valid, but 9/31/2000 is not. (September has only 30 days.)
(Note: you can either take the number in the form <month>/<day>/<year> and parse the string, or just use three input statements.)
It may help to know that a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is a century year that is not divisible by 400. (1800 and 1900 are not leap years while 1600 and 2000 are.)</year></day></month></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify a list of test inputs for your program to verify that it works for the variety of values that a user might provide. In the comments of main.py, list these input values and the results that get printed to the screen.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
