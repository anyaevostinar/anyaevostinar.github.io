## Goals
To better ultimately understand the conceptual material in this class, you will have the opportunity to correct questions that you get wrong on exams for half points back or to bring your total score up to 70%, whichever is higher.

Note that you are highly encouraged to discuss your corrections with me (Anya), because often your friends will be incorrect in how you should correct your answers.

## Due Date
Corrections will be due one week from the return of the exam, at the beginning of class.

There is no extension policy because these are optional.

## Collaboration
You can consult with anyone and anything to understand what you got incorrect on the exam.
You will need to indicate whom you consulted with at the top of the document you submit.
While you can get help, everything that you write must be in your own words.
You cannot copy someone else's correct answer.

## Format
To get **half** points back on the questions you missed on the exam, you must **handwrite on a separate piece of paper** your corrections.
Yes, it **must** be handwritten.
You should have an initial section titled **Collaborations** where you indicate who/what you got help from to correct your exam.
Then, for each question that you want to correct:
* Provide a correct answer.
* Explain why your initial answer was incorrect and what your misunderstanding was. This shouldn't be simply "I didn't know"; even if you guessed, you should explain why you guessed the way that you did. If you didn't answer the original question, you should explain what about your study or time management habits led to you being unable to answer the question and how you are working to correct that.

## Grading
For each question that you completely correct, you will get half of the missed points back. 
You will only get points back if you follow the above directions exactly.
You must correct all missed points and follow the above directions exactly to qualify for the 70% minimum. 
If you are in this position, you should definitely come talk to me to make sure that everything is correct.
