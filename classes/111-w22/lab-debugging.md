This is a lab assignment and so you will not be submitting it.
However, the concepts and practice will help you on both the homework and exams so I encourage you to make a serious effort on it during class and consider finishing it outside of class.

I recommend making a folder for today's lab in COURSES as you usually do.

## Exercise 1
Download the buggy program [`stats_buggy.py`](stats_buggy.py). 
Use the techniques from the reading to debug this program.

There are both syntax and semantic errors in the program. 
After you fix the syntax errors, you should determine what the correct output for a small amount of numbers would be and use that to help your debugging of the semantic errors.
If you aren't familiar with how to take the sample standard deviation of a set of numbers, [here is a guide](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html).

## Exercise 2
You didn't encounter every type of error when debugging that program and it's always good to see a minimal set of code that produces an error.
Write a snippet of code that produces each of the following errors from the reading:
* SyntaxError
* Infinite loop
* NameError
* TypeError
* AttributeError
* IndexError

## Extra
If you finish early, go back to revisit previous labs that you and your partner would like more practice with.
