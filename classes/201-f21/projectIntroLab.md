## Goals
To get a good start on the final project by thinking of several possible projects that would satisfy the requirements.

## Logistics
This is a lab assignment that you'll be handing in on Moodle. You should complete it on Friday Nov 12th, but isn't due until Monday Nov 15th at 5:00pm Central.
However, the sooner you submit, the sooner you'll get feedback from me on your ideas (and it would be great if you could submit it shortly after class on Friday).

Open a text document. You won't be required to write code for this lab.

You should complete this lab with your assigned final project partner if you have one.

## Exercise 0
Add a section to the top of your document titled Collaborations and record any interactions you have with people or other resources as you work on this lab. Include the names of you and your assigned final project partner if you have one.

## Exercise 1

a. If you haven't already, read through the [final project page](final-project). If you read it previously, still open it up to reference.

b. Even if you have an idea already, it's good to come up with several alternatives, so create two headers in your document:
* Game
* Simulation

## Exercise 2
In the "Game" section of your document, come up with **two** game final projects that would fit the requirements. Specify:
* What game you could implement
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what methods/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other **two** class concepts you would use for the implementation

Discuss with a group near you what ideas you've each come up with (don't worry if there is overlap, that's fine! Everyone can do a chess game if they want).

## Exercise 3
In the "Simulation" section of your document, come up with **two things** that you'd like to simulate that you could implement for the final project requirements. You could do something like the [artificial life simulator](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/alife-assignment) that I've required in past versions of this course (though you'd need to add to it). 

Specify:
* What you would simulate and what you could learn from the simulation
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what method/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other **two** class concepts you would use for the implementation

Discuss with another group what ideas you've each come up with.

## Exercise 5
Indicate which of the four above ideas you are thinking of doing or detail another one if your idea doesn't fit into any of the above categories. I (Anya) will attempt to look over the one you specify to make sure that it is within the scope of the final project, but if you are unsure, you should definitely reach out to me ASAP. I'm happy to talk about it!

## Submitting
This is not a homework assignment, so you will be graded on effort.
More importantly though, this is a great chance to get some ideas down and get feedback from me on if they are a good direction for your final project, so take this seriously. 

Unlike normal labs **only one partner needs to submit the document to Moodle** and I've set it up so that it should show as completed for both of you.
It's expecting you to either copy and paste or upload a document file.

Please try to submit this during or immediately after class so that I can look everything over Friday afternoon. If you are not able to, that's fine, but I probably won't be able to get you feedback until Monday.
