## Goals
To better ultimately understand the conceptual material in this class, you will have the opportunity to correct questions that you get wrong on quizzes for half points back.

## Due Date
Corrections will be due one week from the return of the quiz at the beginning of class.
Sometimes quizzes will be returned on Friday after you take them and sometimes I won't be able to grade them and get them back to you until Monday.
In either case, the corrections will be due a week after that day at the beginning of class.

There is no extension policy because these are optional.

## Collaboration
You can consult with anyone and anything to understand what you got incorrect on the quiz.
You will need to indicate whom you consulted with at the top of the document you submit.
While you can get help, everything that you write must be in your own words.
You cannot copy someone else's correct answer.

## Format
To get **half** points back on the questions you missed on the quiz, you must handwrite on a separate piece of paper and staple it to your quiz.
Yes, it **must** be handwritten.
You should have an initial section titled **Collaborations** where you indicate who/what you got help from to correct your quiz.
Then, for each question that you want to correct:
* Provide a correct answer.
* Explain why your initial answer was incorrect and what your misunderstanding was. This shouldn't be simply "I didn't know"; even if you guessed, you should explain why you guessed the way that you did.

## Grading
For each question that you completely correct, you will get half of the missed points back. 
You will only get points back if you follow the above directions exactly.
