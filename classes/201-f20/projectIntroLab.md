## Goals
To get a good start on the final project by thinking of several possible projects that would satisfy the requirements.

## Logistics
This is a lab assignment that you'll be handing in on Moodle. You should complete it on Friday Nov 13th, but isn't due until Monday Nov 16th at 5:00pm Central.

Open a text document. You won't be required to write code for this lab.

You're welcome to work on this lab with input from one or more members of your collaborative learning group. You should write all of your own code, but you're welcome to share your screen/use multiplayer mode with members of your collaborative learning group to look at one another's code, make suggestions, and compare ideas. Take a look at the Collaboration Policies document on Moodle if you have any questions about what's permitted.

## Exercise 0
Add a section to the top of your document titled Collaborations and record any interactions you have with your collaborative learning group or other resources as you work on this lab.

## Exercise 1

a. If you haven't already, read through the [final project page](/classes/201-f20/finalProject). If you read it previously, still open it up to reference.

b. Even if you have an idea already, it's good to come up with several alternatives, so create three headers in your document:
* Game
* Analysis
* Simulation

## Exercise 2
In the "Game" section of your document, come up with a game final project that would fit the requirements. Specify:
* What game you could implement
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what methods/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other class concept you would use for the implementation

## Exercise 3
In the "Analysis" section of your document, come up with a analyzer tool that you could implement for the final project requirements. This could be similar to HW3 in that it would use object-oriented principles create objects that handle the analysis and produce a plot.

Specify:
* What analysis tool you could implement (perhaps a general data set category and what you would like to know about it, perhaps just a spin on HW3)
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what methods/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other class concept you would use for the implementation

## Exercise 4
In the "Simulation" section of your document, come up with something that you'd like to simulate that you could implement for the final project requirements. You could do something like the [artificial life simulator](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/alife-assignment) that I've required in past versions of this course. 

Specify:
* What you would simulate and what you could learn from the simulation
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what method/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other class concept you would use for the implementation

## Exercise 5
Indicate which of the three above ideas you are thinking of doing or detail another one if your idea doesn't fit into any of the above categories. I (Anya) will attempt to look over the one you specify to make sure that it is within the scope of the final project, but if you are unsure, you should definitely reach out to me ASAP. I'm happy to talk about it!

## Submitting
This is not a homework assignment and so your grade will be based on whether you attempted each part. Submit your document to Moodle.
