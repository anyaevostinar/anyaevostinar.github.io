## Goals
To get a better understanding of how to calculate the efficiency of algorithms - developing both your ability to work through calculations mathematically and your intuitive sense of estimating big-O

## Logistics
This is a lab assignment that you'll be handing in on Moodle. You should complete it on Monday Sept 28th, but it isn't due until Wednesday Sept 30th at 5:00pm Central.

There is no coding in this assignment, so you will submit a PDF of your solutions. You have several options for how to produce this PDF:
* Write it by hand and scan it into a PDF. If you do this, you must write very neatly and clearly. Make sure to check that your scan is completely legible!
* Write it in a word processing program, then export or print it to PDF.
* Write it in LaTeX and typeset it as a PDF. LaTeX is complicated to use at first but allows you to format math very nicely. [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a nice website to use for writing LaTeX. 

I recommend just using a word processing program and exporting/printing to PDF!

You're welcome to work on this lab with input from one or more members of your collaborative learning group. You should write all of your own answers and you should not use any notes from talks with others while writing up your assignment. If you need notes, it likely means you still don't quite understand how to do the problem. Go back over your notes, ask more questions, or try to solve a similar problem on your own. Then come back a day or so later and try to write up your solution without your notes.

You're also (as always) welcome to post questions on Piazza to the whole class.
