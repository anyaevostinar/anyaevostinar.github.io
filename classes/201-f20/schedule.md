This is a rough schedule of topics for each day and the release and due dates for each homework assignment. Homework assignments (especially later ones) often have a slightly longer time between release and due date than the daily class activities, which are typically assigned on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday and due the by the following class day. 

**Class topics and homework information may change over the course of the term.** Please treat this schedule as a rough guide for seeing what we'll be focusing on, and expect that there will be shifts as the term progresses.
