## Overview
This document covers four types of tools: tools for written question-and-answer or other communications (Piazza); video conferencing tools (Zoom); tools to make the online coding tools free (GitHub Student Developer pack); and tools for online coding (repl.it).

## Piazza
Please click the link on [Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/course/view.php?id=32745) to get to [Piazza](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=523280). 
Piazza is a question and answer platform, where our site is restricted just to members of our class. 
All written questions and clarifications will happen on Piazza. 
If there's something you'd like to keep private, you can message me privately on Piazza. 
Past students have found Piazza to be a very helpful way to quickly get responses to questions, as it lets your classmates respond to and see your questions in addition to me responding to your questions. 
You'll also communicate with your homework group on Piazza. 
If you prefer that your classmates not know that you're the one posting for questions to the full class, you can post anonymously. 
Given the online nature of our class, I encourage you to consider posting non-anonymously to boost community. 
Please make sure you're respectful of everyone in your interactions on Piazza. 
Once you're logged in to Piazza, click on the “Q & A” tab and look around at the various threads. 
Please email me ([vostinar@carleton.edu](mailto:vostinar@carleton.edu)) if you experience any trouble getting to Piazza. 
If you can access Piazza but experience any troubles with tools later in this document, please use Piazza to ask questions.

The question-and-answer part of Piazza is just shared with our class. 
Piazza also has a product called "Piazza Network" that has the business model of making your data available to companies that might be interested in hiring you. 
This could be something you want, but you may also be legitimately concerned about your privacy. 
**You do not need to sign up for the Piazza Network**: when you create an account, you'll have the option to opt in or opt out, and you can change your decision at any time. 
You can learn more about this by taking a look at the [sign up information here](https://piazza.com/studentsignup), and you can also read more about how Piazza protects your privacy for the [question and answer part here](https://piazza.com/legal/ferpa). 
I encourage you to consider opting out of the Piazza Network if you're at all uncomfortable or concerned with any of the ways that they might use your data.

## Zoom
All video interactions this term will be conducted through [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), an online video conferencing tool. 
My Zoom 'office' is [here](https://carleton.zoom.us/j/8031211072?pwd=WVI1ZFZON2luV1FMT0R5NjVhZHQ0Zz09) and I'll also post this to Moodle.  
There are also Zoom apps for Android/iOS that you can download through the PlayStore/AppStore on your device, and a phone number you can call in to as an alternative way to join the meeting. 
Before our first class, I encourage you to try Zoom (call a friend!) so that you know you can use it on your device. 
The first day of class I imagine we'll all be navigating some challenges with the platform, but trying it out ahead of time will make things a little easier. 
You don't need a camera for our class, although if you have one, that's great; similarly, a microphone isn't required (you can ask questions and participate through chat), but if you have a device with a microphone, that will make it easier to participate.
You aren't required to turn on your camera, though it can help you feel more like you are 'in class'.
You are welcome to attend class meetings in pajamas in bed, I just want you to attend!

## Coding environment
For CS201 this term, the primary way we'll be doing coding is online. We're doing this for two reasons:

* An online coding environment provides the same experience for all students, rather than forcing everyone to try to set up Java and a terminal on their own machines, and that gives all of the course staff more time to support you on the concepts rather than on troubleshooting the setup.
* An online coding environment makes it easier for you to collaborate with one another and for me, lab assistants, and our prefect to see exactly what you're working on when you ask for help.

The environment we'll be using is [repl.it](https://repl.it/).

### repl.it
[repl.it](https://repl.it/) allows you to write and run code in lots of different languages. 
For our class, we'll be using the Java programming language (don't worry, you aren't expected to know it yet!). 
Lab activities and assignments will be released through our Classroom on repl.it. 
You can join our classroom by clicking on the invite linked on Moodle. 
When prompted, click the middle icon on the password screen that looks a little like a cat (![octocat icon](/classes/201-f20/git-icon.png)), and then enter your Carleton email address. 
You may be prompted to create a new account on repl.it; you should use the first and last name that you go by for this account. 
By the time you're done, you should see our classroom. 
If it doesn't bring you directly to the classroom page, click on your account name, then "student" and you should see an icon for CS201 Data Structures. 
The page will look something like the image below:

Check out the repl.it video on Moodle if you're confused, and if that doesn't help, ask on Piazza.

The department has a deal with Repl.it to upgrade all student accounts so that you can have private Repls. I will provide information on Piazza about how to upgrade and you should then make all your code for the class private.

### Coding on your own computer
I know that some of you may want to use something offline for coding. 
If this is due to internet connectivity reasons, then I'm happy to try to support that. 
If this is not for internet connectivity reasons, then I discourage this due to the advantages above of using an online environment. 
If you do want to install Java on your own computer, we have instructions on the CS website, and if you're using Windows, you many want to consider [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), which is a Microsoft-supported conversion layer which is a safe and easy way for students running Windows to be able to interact with a terminal in the same way as Mac/Linux users. 
If you need help with these resources and the reason you're using them is poor internet connectivity, please contact me via Piazza.

Regardless of why you want to code offline, you should be sure that you have an account on repl.it because you'll need it to access starter files for homeworks and lab activities.
