## Overview
We'll start our exploration of ADTs with one of the simplest: the stack. The ability to simply place an item on a *stack* and remove items last-in, first-out can be used to elegantly solve many problems. Today, we'll focus on how we can use the humble stack ADT.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain the difference between an ADT and a data structure
* Explain what a stack is and how items are added and removed
* Define LIFO
* Explain the balanced parentheses problem

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own version of a stack
* Use a stack to solve a problem

## Checks
Submit answers to the follows on Moodle:

```

```

1. Given the stack above,
    a. What will calling `peek()` on this stack return? 
    b. What will the stack look like after calling `peek()`?

2. Given the status of the stack after Step 1, 
    a. What will calling `pop()` on this stack return? 
    b. What will the stack look like after calling `pop()`?

3. Given the status of the stack after Step 2,
    a. What will calling `push(“Allison”)` on this stack return? 
    b. What will the stack look like after calling  `push(“Allison”)`?
