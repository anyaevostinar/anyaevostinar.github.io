## Overview
There are many problems that can't be represented and solved using the linear or tree structures that we've seen so far. To tackle these problems, we need a more general structure that allows us to have nodes connected to any number of other nodes. This kind of structure is called a graph. Today we'll be focused on the two main ways that we can implement a graph in programming.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what nodes and vertices (plural of vertex) are in a graph
* Explain the difference between an adjacency matrix and adjacency list


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain how to add nodes/vertices and edges to a graph & how to check if nodes/vertices and edges are in a graph
* Demonstrate how to represent graphs in both adjacency matrix and list form
* Decide whether to use a matrix or list implementation of a graph based on the constraints of a given problem

## Checks
Submit your answers to the following on Moodle.

Given the following graph:

1. Draw out the graph represented as an adjacency matrix.
2. Draw out the graph represented as an adjacency list.
