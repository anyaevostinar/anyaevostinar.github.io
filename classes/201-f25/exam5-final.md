* HP2-AD: Use a heap or priority queue to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode
* SO1: Demonstrate quicksort on a diagram
* SO2: Define the best and worst case Big-O of quicksort
* SO3: Define the worst-case Big-O of heapsort
* SO4-AD: Explain the idea behind the Big-O of quicksort
* SO5-AD: Explain the idea behind the Big-O of heapsort

* TR2: Demonstrate insertion/deletion in a binary search tree
* TR3: Demonstrate adding to a 2-3 tree
* TR4-AD: Use an appropriate tree to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode

* GR1: Identify the full sequence of BFS

* SQ7-AD: Use the appropriate data structure to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode
* SH3-AD: Explain how you get the Big-O of a specified hashing operation
* RC2-AD: Write a recursive function in very clear pseudocode

I will include your answers to this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOwj5JH5_ppPoDJSxnbNpU8gvemqovDVNRW65kn42MwYoKtQ/viewform?usp=dialog) in your self-scheduled exam packet.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters of the Runestone book that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the exam objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
