## Exam Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the exams in this class are meant to assess your ability on a specific set of core and advanced learning objectives.
Each exam will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate your ability on for that exam, and most learning objective will appear on at least 2 exams (a few at the end won't have time, but you'll have the chance to practice). 

## Exam Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will ultimately all be assessed via exams are:
