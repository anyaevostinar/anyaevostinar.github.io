## Goals
To implement a binary search tree.

## Setup
Mount the COURSES drive and remember to save everything into STUWORK. **If you don't do this, everything you write will disappear when you log out!!!!**
* Create a new folder in your STUWORK called `BSTLab`
* Download the [starter code](/classes/201-f25/BSTLab.kt) and put it into your lab folder
* Open your `BSTLab` folder in VSCode

## Exercise 1
Look at the code in `main` and draw out what the binary search tree will look like after all the insertion steps.

## Exercise 2
Start with implementing `insertKey`. Remember to save the values from the recursive calls and set them to the appropriate variables! Try out running your code and make sure that you get a correct in order traversal.

## Exercise 3
No implement `minValue`, a helper function that you'll want. Remember to test your code by adding a call to `minValue` in main.

## Exercise 4
Finally implement `deleteRec` and make sure that everything works.


Upload your completed lab to Moodle for an extra engagement credit.

## Extra
Binary search trees can easily become imbalanced and lose all their benefits. How could you detect that your tree was becoming imbalanced and fix it?
