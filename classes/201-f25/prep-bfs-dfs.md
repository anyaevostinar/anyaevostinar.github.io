## Overview
There are many different ways that you can use graphs to solve problems, but two of the main algorithms are focused on how you search through the graph: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Today we'll consider these two algorithms and their time complexities.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of breadth- and depth-first search
* Explain the time complexity of both algorithms

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement breadth- and depth-first search
* Demonstrate the time complexity of both

## Reading
You should read the following
* [7.7 The Word Ladder Problem](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/graphs_the-word-ladder-problem.html?mode=browsing)
* [7.9 Breadth-First Search](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/graphs_implementing-breadth-first-search.html?mode=browsing)
* [7.10 BFS Analysis](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/graphs_breadth-first-search-analysis.html?mode=browsing)
* [7.15 Depth-First Search](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/graphs_general-depth-first-search.html?mode=browsing)
* [7.16 DFS Analysis](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/graphs_depth-first-search-analysis.html?mode=browsing)

## Checks
Submit your answers to Moodle.

Given the following graph and assuming neighbors are processed in numerical order from least to greatest:

![Graph](/classes/201-f25/graph2check.png)

1. What is the breadth-first traversal of the graph, starting from node 7?
2. What is the depth-first traversal of the graph, starting from node 7?
