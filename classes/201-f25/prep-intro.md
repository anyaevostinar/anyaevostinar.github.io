## Overview
Welcome to Data Structures!
Every class day, there will be a prep page like this that will detail what you should **do** and **understand** *before* class time, as well as what you should do and understand during and after class on the topic.
Today's objective are mostly about the class structure itself, because it's a little different than you might be used to.

You should always aim to be **proficient** in the *basic learning objectives* before class by going through the readings and videos and completing the specified exercises (and reach out for help ahead of time if you need).

## Basic Learning Objectives
These are the learning objectives that each student is responsible for practicing **BEFORE** the class meeting (though if you are adding late or don't have a chance to do them before class, just do them as soon as you can!). 
There will generally be checks that you submit to Moodle for an engagement credit (details in the Syllabus).
If you are having trouble completing these checks, you should reach out for help before class if you can.

Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain how this class' grading structure differs from most
* Explain what kinds of collaboration are and aren't allowed
* Explain the overall timeline of when assignments are due and when exams occur

## Advanced Learning Objectives
The following objectives should  be mastered by each student during and following our class session through our in-class work:

You should be able to:
* Explain what the AI policy is in the class
* Explain how exams and homework assessment leads to your final grade
* Explain what *data structures* are
* Identify how to write basic Kotlin using a reference sheet

## Readings
You should read each of the following:

* [Syllabus](syllabus)
* [Schedule](schedule)
* [Collaboration Policy](collaboration)

## Checks
You should do these checks on Moodle:
* Complete the background survey
* Answer the following questions:
    1. When are preparation assignments due?
    2. What are the dates of the exams in this class?
    3. How does the grading structure in this class differ from a traditional structure? (You should aim for 2-3 sentences.)
    4. What is the general idea of the AI policy in this class? (You should aim for 2-3 sentences.)
