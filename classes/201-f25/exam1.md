## Learning Objectives

The subset of [learning objectives](exams-overview) that you can demonstrate your understanding of for exam 1 are:

* KF1: Define variables for basic types
* KF2: Write if-else statements
* KF3: Write a basic indefinite and definite loop
* KF4: Write a specified function 
* KF5: Instantiate and use an object
* KF6-AD: Implement a specified interface
* KF7-AD: Implement a subclass
* TC1: Order polynomial complexity classes
* TC2-AD: Order mixes of polynomial, logarithmic, and exponential complexity classes
* RC1: Define the three laws of recursion
* RC2-AD: Write a recursive function in very clear pseudocode

You will be allowed to bring [your checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OdcJHtAV-88h3KMlmrHMGhQa_ZN-B4rTEeDtlFlxks0/edit?usp=sharing) with you but there should be no writing on it other than your name and you will submit it with your exam. I'll return them after the exam. If you have lost your original copy, you can print out a new **stapled** copy to bring.

## Suggestions
Remember that this isn't your only chance to demonstrate your understanding of these learning objectives, so try not to stress too much.
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters of the Runestone book that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the quiz objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
