## Overview
As you now know, there are some core things that every programming language has. You've seen the syntax already during the scavenger hunt, but now it's time to think a bit more deeply about what all the syntax was doing.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to explain the following in Kotlin:
* Basic types
* Collections
* Control flow
* Functions

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Write Kotlin using basic types, collections, control flow, and functions

## Readings
To achieve the pre-class learning objectives, you should read the following sections in the Kotlin tour:

* [Hello World](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-hello-world.html)
* [Basic Types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-basic-types.html)
* [Collections](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-collections.html)
* [Control Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-control-flow.html)
* [Functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-functions.html) - Up to but not including Lambda expressions


## Checks
You should submit answers to the following on the Gradescope assignment linked through Moodle (note that you can and should [try typing up and running your answers](https://pl.kotl.in/2YMTJHlUF)). You may upload them in the same file or different files and the name of the files doesn't matter.
1. The code below computes a student’s GPA, but some lines are in the wrong order. Put the lines in the correct order. The output of this program should be: 

    ```
    Student’s GPA: 3.65
    ```

2. Given a list of letter grades from a student’s transcript, the function `calculateGPA` computes a student’s GPA based on [Carleton’s grading system](https://www.carleton.edu/handbook/academics/?policy=385&a=student), but some parts are missing. Fill in the blanks for the code for the function `calculateGPA`. (`main` is already complete.)  The output of this program should be:
    ```
    Student’s GPA: 3.25
    Student’s GPA: 2.42
    Student’s GPA: 2.17
    ```
