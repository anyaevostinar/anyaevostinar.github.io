## Set up
Follow the steps from the [Scavenger Hunt](kotlin-lab) to mount the COURSES drive. Make a folder `RadixSortLab` in your STUWORK/username folder and open it in VSCode for today's labwork.

Note, this lab is very much a self-driven exploration, so ask questions and try things out!

## Bin sort
Start out translating the [reading's binsort](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/BinSort.html) to Kotlin to get the hang of things. Remember to write some test code and make sure things are working!

## Radix sort

Next try to implement Radix sort [based on the reading](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/RadixSort.html) in Kotlin. You could either start with the linked list version, or go right to translating the array-based Java version to Kotlin.

If you finish and are willing to have your implementation used with the Spring 2026 class, I would love for you to email it to me! (Maybe I'll get around to translating it myself by then, but maybe not.)
