## Overview
We will finally move away from linear structures and start thinking about ways of storing data that have more complicated connections. Today we'll focus on a group of structures referred to as *trees* due to their ability to branch. An interesting thing about trees is that the order in which you go through the nodes, *traversing*, can greatly change based on what you are trying to accomplish!

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what the tree ADT is
* Explain how a tree data structure can be implemented
* Explain what the three tree traversals are

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own code for traversing a tree in three different orders

## Resources
You should read the following:
* [6.2 Examples of Trees](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_examples-of-trees.html?mode=browsing)
* [6.3 Vocabulary](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_vocabulary-and-definitions.html?mode=browsing)
* [6.6 Nodes and References](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_nodes-and-references.html?mode=browsing)
* [6.8 Tree Traversals](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_tree-traversals.html?mode=browsing)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle.

Given this tree:

1. What is the result of an inorder traversal?
2. What is the result of a preorder traversal?
3. What is the result of a postorder traversal?
