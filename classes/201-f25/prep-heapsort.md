## Overview
There is one more specialty sorting algorithm that we are going to consider, and it is interesting because it relies on a data structure that you already know about: heapsort! Heapsort relies on a particularly fast implementation of the method for building a heap, so we're going to review that as well.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of heapsort
* Explain how a heap can be built in `O(n)` time

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the idea behind the Big-O of heapsort

## Reading
You should read the following:
* [OpenDSA 12.17.2 Building a Heap](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/Heaps.html#building-a-heap)
* [OpenDSA 13.12 Heapsort](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/Heapsort.html)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following:
* Given the list `[4, 3, 5, 6, 1]`, draw out the steps for performing heapsort with both the array of the heap and the tree visualization.
* What are the situations where heapsort is better to use than quicksort?
