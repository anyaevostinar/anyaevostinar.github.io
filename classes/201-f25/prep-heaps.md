## Overview
Another unique kind of tree, called a heap, can be used for implementing solutions to several different problems, including the *priority queue* ADT and a special sorting algorithm, *heapsort*. Today we'll focus on this data structure and some of what it is used for.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define what the *priority queue* ADT is
* Define what *complete* means for binary trees
* Explain how a heap maintains its nodes

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a heap
* Analyze the time complexity of heap and priority queue operations

## Reading
You should read the following:
* [6.9 Priority Queues with Binary Heaps](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_priority-queues-with-binary-heaps.html?mode=browsing)
* [6.10 Binary Heap Operations](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_binary-heap-operations.html?mode=browsing)
* [6.11 Binary Heap Implementation](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/trees_binary-heap-implementation.html?mode=browsing)

## Checks

Submit your answers to the following on Moodle. Given this min-heap:

![Diagram of heap](/classes/201-f25/heapcheck.png)

1. Draw out the heap after inserting 11.
2. Given the min-heap after Q1, draw out the heap after inserting 2.
3. Given the min-heap after Q2, draw out the heap after calling delete 14.
4. Given the min-heap after Q3, draw out the heap after calling delete 4.
