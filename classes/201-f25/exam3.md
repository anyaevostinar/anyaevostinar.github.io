## Learning Objectives

The subset of [learning objectives](exams-overview) that you can demonstrate your understanding of for exam 3 are:

New:
* TR1: Identify in-order, pre-order and/or post-order tree traversal
* TR2: Demonstrate insertion/deletion in a binary search tree
* TR3: Demonstrate adding to a 2-3 tree
* TR4-AD: Use an appropriate tree to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode

* GR1: Identify the full sequence of BFS
* GR2: Identify the full sequence of DFS
* GR3: Define the Big-O of BFS and DFS
* GR4-AD Explain the idea behind the Big-O of BFS and DFS
* GR5-AD: Use a graph to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode


Retake:
* LI1: Demonstrate the effects of a sequence of linked-list operations
* LI7-AD: Use the appropriate list to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode
* SQ6-AD: Demonstrate how you get the Big-O of a specified queue operation
* SQ7-AD: Use the appropriate data structure to solve a problem in very clear pseudocode
* SH1: Demonstrate the effects of a sequence of set and hash table operations
* SH2: Define the worst case Big-O of a specified hashing operation
* SH3-AD: Explain how you get the Big-O of a specified hashing operation
* KF3: Write a basic indefinite and definite loop
* KF7-AD: Implement a subclass
* RC2-AD: Write a recursive function in very clear pseudocode

You will be allowed to bring [your checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OdcJHtAV-88h3KMlmrHMGhQa_ZN-B4rTEeDtlFlxks0/edit?usp=sharing) with you but there should be no writing on it other than your name and you will submit it with your exam. I'll return them after the exam. If you have lost your original copy, you can print out a new **stapled** copy to bring.

## Suggestions
Remember that this isn't your only chance to demonstrate your understanding of these learning objectives, so try not to stress too much.
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters of the Runestone book that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the exam objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
