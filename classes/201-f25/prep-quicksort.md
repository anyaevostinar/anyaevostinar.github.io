## Overview
Mergesort is pretty good, but with some small tweaks, it can get even better. It's time to think a bit more about this seemingly simple problem by examining one of the fastest sorting algorithms: quicksort.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of quicksort
* Define the terms *pivot value* and *split point*
* Explain why quicksort is typically faster than other sorting algorithms

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own median of three algorithm
* Analyze how different factors of a list impact quicksort's performance
* Explain the idea behind the Big-O of quicksort

## Reading
You should read the following:
* [Runestone 5.12 Quicksort](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/sort-search_the-quicksort.html?mode=browsing)
* [Runestone 5.13 Sorting Summary](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pswadsup/sort-search_summary.html?mode=browsing)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following (I recommend drawing out the sorting on paper and uploading a picture):
1. Given the list `[4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]`
    * Draw out the steps of mergesorting the list
    * Draw out the steps of quicksorting the list
2. What are the main differences in the implementation of quicksort and mergesort?
