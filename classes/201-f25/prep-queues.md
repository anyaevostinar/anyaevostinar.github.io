## Overview
While lists are a good general linear structure, you don't always need all of the functionality and complexity of them. Today we are focused on a simpler, but vital, data structure: the queue.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain what a queue is and how items are added and removed
* Define FIFO


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the efficiency concerns related to implementing a queue
* Explain how a circular queue works
* Explain how a linked queue works


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=928125):

* 3.10, 3.11,  3.14
* Optional additional resource: [OpenDSA Queues](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/CS2/html/Queue.html)
* Optional: [Fairytales about Stacks and Queues](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/04/stacks-queues-priority-queues-and.html)
