## Goal
Get your laptop setup for the course and start refreshing on Python.

## Laptop Setup
Jeff Ondich has a nice walk through for setting up your computer for this course, so work through [Section 2. Set up a Unix command-line interface on your work computer](https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/courses/cs257_f21/assignments/01_setup.html#unix).

I recommend you also install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) since it's what I'll be using to demonstrate things and it has a whole lot of really useful extensions, such as [Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) and [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share).

Also work through Section 3 but don't make a repository yet and send your GitHub username [to this survey](https://forms.gle/WvAfZEb6CR6t8ocCA) instead.

## Python Refreshing
Work through exercises 1 and 3 of [this lab](https://anyaevostinar.github.io/classes/111-w22/files).
If you're really rusty or need a reference, check out [W3 Schools' tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp).

## Unix Tutorial
If you've gotten this far, feel free to start on the [Unix Tutorial](https://www.cs.carleton.edu/courses/course_resources/Unix2/) which is the prep for Friday.
