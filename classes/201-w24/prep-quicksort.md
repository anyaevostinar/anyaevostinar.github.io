## Overview
You've previously thought a bit about sorting a list, but it's time to think a bit more about this seemingly simple problem by examining one of the fastest sorting algorithms: quicksort.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of quicksort
* Define the terms *pivot value* and *split point*
* Explain why quicksort is typically faster than other sorting algorithms

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own median of three algorithm
* Analyze how different factors of a list impact quicksort's performance

## Reading
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [5.6, 5.12, 5.13](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=908534)
