## Goals
To get a good start on the final project by thinking of several possible projects that would satisfy the requirements.

## Setup

a. If you haven't already, read through the [final project page](final-project). If you read it previously, still open it up to reference.

b. Create a Google Doc and share it with your partner (if you have one) to record your initial planning today.

c. Even if you have an idea already, it's good to come up with several alternatives, so create two headers in your document:
* Game
* Simulation

## Exercise 1
In the "Game" section of your document, come up with **two** game final projects that would fit the requirements. Specify:
* What game you could implement
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what methods/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other **two** class concepts you would use for the implementation

Discuss with a group near you what ideas you've each come up with (don't worry if there is overlap, that's fine! Everyone can do a chess game if they want).

## Exercise 2
In the "Simulation" section of your document, come up with **two things** that you'd like to simulate that you could implement for the final project requirements. 

Specify:
* What you would simulate and what you could learn from the simulation
* What the superclass would be and what methods/variables it would have
* What the subclasses would be and what method/variables they would have in addition to the superclass'
* What other **two** class concepts you would use for the implementation

Discuss with another group what ideas you've each come up with.

## Exercise 3
Indicate which of the four above ideas you are thinking of doing or detail another one if your idea doesn't fit into any of the above categories. You'll share at the end of class. Then get started on the project proposal (submission link on Moodle) and your [minimum viable product](project-checkin).
