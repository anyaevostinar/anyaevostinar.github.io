Because this is a self-scheduled exam, you can't bring your checklist yourself. Instead, you can fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxPswAynm7x8H2jBif_PVx5JlaISWecFOznZiIniS173Fp0g/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Wednesday March 6th at 10pm and I will print and include them in the exam for you.

## Suggestions
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the quiz objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
