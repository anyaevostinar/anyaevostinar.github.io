## Quiz Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the quizzes in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each quiz will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate proficiency/mastery in for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 quizzes.

## Quiz Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will ultimately all be assessed via quizzes are:
1. Defining variables with appropriate type in Java
2. Writing loops (definite and indefinite) in Java
3. Writing conditional statements in Java
4. Defining methods in Java
5. Instantiating and using objects in Java
6. Using interfaces
7. Using inheritance
8. Using linked lists
9. Using arrays
10. Explaining time complexity of linked list operations
11. Explaining time complexity of array operations
12. Using stacks
13. Explaining time complexity of stack operations
14. Using queues
15. Explaining time complexity of queue operations
16. Selecting the appropriate data structure when solving a problem
17. Comparing pros and cons of different ADTs and data structures
18. Explaining quicksort
19. Explaining heapsort
20. Explaining time complexity of quicksort
21. Explaining time complexity of heapsort
22. Using recursion
23. Using balanced binary search trees
24. Using heaps
25. Demonstrating breadth-first search
26. Analyzing time complexity of breadth-first search
27. Demonstrating depth-first search
28. Analyzing time complexity of depth-first search
29. Demonstrating hash tables
30. Explaining time complexity of hashing
