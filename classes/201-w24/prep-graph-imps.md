## Overview
There are many problems that can't be represented and solved using the linear or tree structures that we've seen so far. To tackle these problems, we need a more general structure that allows us to have nodes connected to any number of other nodes. This kind of structure is called a graph. Today we'll be focused on the two main ways that we can implement a graph in programming.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what nodes and vertices (plural of vertex) are in a graph
* Explain the difference between an adjacency matrix and adjacency list


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own graph data structure

## Reading
You should read the following:
* Runestone [7.2-7.6](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=911559)
