## Overview
Another unique kind of tree, called a heap, can be used for implementing solutions to several different problems, including the *priority queue* ADT and a special sorting algorithm, *heapsort*. Today we'll focus on this data structure and what is is used for.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define what the *priority queue* ADT is
* Define what *complete* means for binary trees
* Explain how a heap maintains its nodes
* Explain the idea behind heapsort

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement a heap
* Use a heap to perform heapsort

## Reading
You should read/watch the following:
* Runestone [6.9-6.11](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=911534)
* OpenDSA [8.12](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/CS3/html/Heapsort.html)
