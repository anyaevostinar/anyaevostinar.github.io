---

## Overview
We have been using several of Java's built-in data structures so far and its important to have an idea of their time efficiency as we consider the efficiency of our programs. Today's prep is focused on how we can get a sense of what is going on under the hood with `ArrayList` and `HashMap`.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Identify the Big-O efficiency of `ArrayList` and `HashMap` operations
* Explain at a high level what garbage collection is
* Recall what a linked list is at a high level


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Reason about when the Java built-ins should be fastest
* Be able to conduct time experiments
* Be able to implement a linked list


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=907093):

* 2.5- 2.7
* Review [Linked List](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=905601) Reading

## Checks
You should complete the reading checks embedded in the reading assignment on Moodle.
