## Overview
Sometimes the most natural way to solve a problem is to first solve smaller versions of the same problem and then build on that solution.
As strange as it might seem, methods are allowed to call themselves to accomplish just this sort of problem-solving approach.
This is called *recursion* and it can be a bit tricky to wrap your head around at first.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of recursion
* Explain how a method can call itself
* Explain what a *base case* is

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Write a recursive function to solve a problem

## Reading
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [4.1-4.4 & 4.7](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=908522)
