## Overview
While lists are a good general linear structure, you don't always need all of the functionality and complexity of them. Today we are focused on a simpler data structure: the queue.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain what a queue is and how items are added and removed
* Define FIFO


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own version of a queue
* Explain the algorithm for adding and removing items from a queue


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=905631):

* 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.14
* Optional: [Fairytales about Stacks and Queues](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/04/stacks-queues-priority-queues-and.html)

## Checks
No additional checks.
