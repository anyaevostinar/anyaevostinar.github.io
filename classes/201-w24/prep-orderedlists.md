## Overview
Another variety of linear data structure is an *ordered* list, which maintains its elements in a sorted order. You can imagine that this makes certain tasks much easier, but adds complexity to adding elements. Today we will focus on the ADT and how you can implement it.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain the difference between the unordered and ordered list ADTs
* Identify the changes made to the implementation of an ordered list to maintain order


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own specialized ordered list


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=907096):

* 3.22 and 3.23
