## Overview
There is one more linear abstract data type for you to learn, and this one comes in surprisingly useful. The ability to simply place an item on a *stack* and remove items last-in, first-out can be used to elegantly solve many problems. Today, we'll focus on how we can use the humble stack ADT.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain what a stack is and how items are added and removed
* Define LIFO
* Explain the balanced parentheses problem

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement your own version of a stack
* Use a stack to solve a problem


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=905634):

* 3.3-3.7
* Optional additional resource: [OpenDSA Stacks](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/CS2/html/StackArray.html)
