## Overview
Inheritance is powerful, but often you want to require that a class implement specific methods without providing any of the code yourself. Today we're going to learn about a few more Java-specific things, including *interfaces* and get more practice with `ArrayList`.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to: 
* Write a subclass using inheritance
* Identify the keyword for implementing an *interface*
* Explain the difference between using an interface and inheritance
* Give an example of when *static* would be used


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement an interface
* Explain the pros and cons of an interface versus inheritance
* Use an `ArrayList`
* Explain the concept of *static*


## Readings
You should read the [reading assignment through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=903026):

* Java for Python Programmers 1.8

## Checks
You should complete the reading checks embedded in the reading assignment on Moodle.
