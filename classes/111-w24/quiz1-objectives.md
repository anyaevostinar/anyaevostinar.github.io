## Learning Objectives

The subset of [learning objectives](quizzes-overview) that you can demonstrate your proficiency/mastery on for quiz 1 are:

* Using variables
* Predicting the behavior of a program
* Using a function
* Debugging syntax errors (type errors specifically)

## Suggestions
Remember that this isn't your only chance to demonstrate your understanding of these learning objectives, so try not to stress too much.
Good ways to study for the quizzes are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the quiz objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
