## Overview
Being able to write programs that use graphics is a lot of fun and helps with understanding various programming concepts.
There are several different Python *modules* that let you draw pictures, but we're going to focus on one in particular called *turtle*.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain how to add a module to your Python program
* Generate a random number using the *random* module
* Draw a couple of lines using the *turtle* module
* Use a simple for loop

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use the random and turtle modules to draw a more complicated picture
* Use a for loop to reduce the lines of code of your program

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks [through Moodle](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=903021):
* 4.1-4.3 (Intro to Python Modules - The random module)
* 5.1-5.2 (Hello Little Turtles! - Our First Turtle Program)
* 5.5 (Repetition with a For Loop)
* 5.8 (Incremental Programming)
