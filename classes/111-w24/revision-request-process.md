## Overview
As stated on the [syllabus](syllabus), you have the chance to revise homework assignments as many times as you want during the term. 
However, to keep things organized and manageable, there is a process that you need to go through that is detailed here.
**All revisions are to be completed individually, even if it was a paired assignment.**

## First Revision
The first revision on each homework assignment is due a week after the initial submission assessment is released and will generally be assessed fairly soon after the due date.

## Subsequent Revisions
If you wish to revise after you get the feedback from the first revision, you can do so by following these steps:
1. Read the feedback and correct your homework
2. Submit your corrected homework to the same Gradescope assignment (will reopen after the feedback is released)
3. Submit a request on [this form](https://forms.gle/v9BqtTH7CERSXyKK8)
4. Wait for the revision to be assessed, which might take until the end of term, or might happen more quickly than that
5. Repeat from step 1 if you want

**You must submit a request through the form; your submission will not automatically be reassessed for style!**
