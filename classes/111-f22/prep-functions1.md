## Overview
*Functions* are a fantastic way of bundling a series of statements together conceptually to make your code much clearer.
You've already been using them a lot, but now you'll learn how to make your own and how to think through what they are doing.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before the start of class, you should be able to:
* Define the term *function*
* Give an example of invoking an existing function
* Define the term *parameter* 
* Define and use a new function without parameters to accomplish a simple task

## Advanced Learning Objectives
During and after class, you should be able to:
* Explain when the code in a function is executed
* Explain what the *scope* of a function is and how it impacts variables used inside the function
* Define and use a new function with multiple parameters to accomplish a task
* Identify when a function should be created

## Readings

You should read/watch the following and complete the checks:
* Runestone [12.1-12.4](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/intro-cs/Functions/intro-Functions.html)
