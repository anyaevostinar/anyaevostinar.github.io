## Overview
Many problems are best solved by making changes to an existing lists or *mutating* it. Because lists are *mutable*, there are some complications and additional considerations for working with them, which will be the focus of today.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what *mutable* means
* Change the contents of a list using indexing, slicing, deleting, and appending

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Draw a reference diagram to explain changes to a simple list
* Use the accumulator pattern to build up lists and strings
* Use a simple nested list

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:

* Runestone [9.5-9.8](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/intro-cs/TransformingSequences/Aliasing.html)
