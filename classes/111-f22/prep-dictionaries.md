## Overview
*Dictionaries* in programming are an extremely powerful tool when you want to associate two types of information together efficiently.
For example, being able to look up a person's phone number from their name.
Today is focused on the syntax and basic use of them, but you will learn lots more about them in future computer science classes!

* Make a new dictionary
* Add *key-value pairs* to a dictionary
* Look up the value associated with a key

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use a dictionary to solve a programming problem
* Use the accumulator pattern with a dictionary
