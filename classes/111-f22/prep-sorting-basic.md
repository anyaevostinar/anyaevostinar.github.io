## Overview
You've learned about how sorting can be useful, but how do you actually sort a list of items such as numbers or strings? More importantly perhaps, how do you do so as quickly as possible?
Today's focus will be on a set of sorting algorithms that aren't the quickest, but are pretty good.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define what we mean by a sorted list
* Explain the high-level idea of *bubble sort*
* Explain the high-level idea of *selection sort*
* Explain the high-level idea of *insertion sort*

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement selection and insertion sort in code or on paper
* Explain the time complexity of selection and insertion sort

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [5.6-5.9](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/intro-csF22-book3/SortSearch/sorting.html)
