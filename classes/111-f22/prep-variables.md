## Overview
Variables are a core part of programming and misconceptions about them are a frequent source of bugs for new (and experienced!) programmers.
While you've probably heard the word before, what it means in programming might be subtly different than you expect from other contexts.
The preparation work is focused on getting you comfortable with the programming concept and Python syntax, so that we can dive in to building your mental model of variables during class.



## Basic Learning Objectives
These are the learning objectives that each student is responsible for demonstrating proficiency at BEFORE the class meeting. 
You will demonstrate this proficiency by completing embedded questions in the readings, CodeCheck, and submitting answers on Moodle.
If you are having trouble doing so, you should reach out for help before class.

* Be able to define the term variable in a programming context
* Be able to make a new variable in a Python program using an assignment statement
* Be able to use an existing variable in a Python program
* Be able to change an existing variable in a Python program
* Be able to choose legal and descriptive names for your variables

## Advanced Learning Objectives
The following objectives should  be mastered by each student during and following our class session through our in-class work:

* Explain what it means to evaluate a variable and identify when evaluation occurs
* Explain what happens when one variable is assigned the value of another variable 
* Be able to predict what value a variable will have at the end of a program, especially when the program uses and changes multiple variables
* Be able to draw reference diagrams to show what is happening with a variable in a program, especially when the variable is changed
* Be able to use several variables in a program to solve a problem
* Be able to explain the similarities and differences between variables in programming, math, and other contexts

## Readings
You should read/watch each of the following and complete the checks (by following the links through Moodle):

* [Variables](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/Variables.html)
* [Variable Names](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/VariableNamesandKeywords.html)
* [Statements and Expressions](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/StatementsandExpressions.html)
* [Reassignment](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/Reassignment.html)
* [Updating Variables](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/UpdatingVariables.html)

## Checks
In addition to the embedded questions in the readings, you should complete the following CodeChecks (will be linked through Moodle):
* [Exercises 1, 2, and 3](https://codecheck.io/viewAssignment/2012131853ajysxi55gpag2u40h3tmgsjzg)

## Written Answers
Finally, you'll submit answers to the following questions on Moodle:
* What does the term variable mean in a programming context?
* What is the syntax for making a new variable in Python?
