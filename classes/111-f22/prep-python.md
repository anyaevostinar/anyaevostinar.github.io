## Overview
In this class, we'll be using the programming language called **Python** to tell the computer what we want it to do.
Today will be focused on getting some basic definitions and functionality in Python figured out.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the difference between an *algorithm* and a *program*
* Edit and run Python programs embedded in the textbook
* Use the `print` function

## Advanced Learning Objectives

After class, you should be able to:
* Create and run a program using VSCode
* Submit programs to Gradescope
* Edit programs based on Gradescope feedback
* Use pair programming to write a program
