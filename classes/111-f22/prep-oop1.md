## Overview
*Object-oriented programming* is a powerful way of organizing programs that you've already used in bits and pieces.
While it's great to use Python's built in classes such as lists, strings, and turtles, object-oriented programming really shines when you make your own classes.
Today we'll focus on the paradigm of thinking with objects and starting to make your own classes.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define *classes*, *instances*, and *instance variables*
* Create a program with multiple instances of the `Turtle` class
* Identify the syntax to define your own class

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use the classes in a graphics library to draw to a picture
* Start defining your own class

## Resources
You should read/watch the following and complete the embedded checks:
* Runestone [5.3-5.4](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/intro-cs/PythonTurtle/InstancesAHerdofTurtles.html)
* Runestone [20.1-20.5](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/intro-cs/Classes/intro-ClassesandObjectstheBasics.html)
