## Overview
Functions are a fantastic way of bundling a series of statements together conceptually to make your code much clearer.
You've already been using them a lot, but now you'll learn how to make your own and how to think through what they are doing.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before the start of class, you should be able to:
* Define the term "function"
* Give an example of invoking an existing function
* Define the term "parameter" 
* Define and use a new function without parameters to accomplish a simple task

## Advanced Learning Objectives
During and after class, you should be able to:
* Explain when the code in a function is executed
* Explain what the *scope* of a function is and how it impacts variables used inside the function
* Define and use a new function with multiple parameters to accomplish a task

## Readings

You should read/watch each of the following and complete the checks:
* [Introduction to Functions](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Functions/intro-Functions.html?mode=browsing)
* [Function Definition](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Functions/FunctionDefinitions.html?mode=browsing)
* [Function Invocation](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Functions/FunctionInvocation.html?mode=browsing)
* [Function Parameters](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Functions/FunctionParameters.html?mode=browsing)

## Checks
TBD, will include 'write a function that prints X' and 'use this function to do Y'

## Written Answers
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* What does 'function' mean in programming?
* What does 'parameter' mean in programming?
* What is the syntax for making a new function in Python?
