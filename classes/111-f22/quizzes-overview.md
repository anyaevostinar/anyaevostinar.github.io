## Quiz Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the quizzes in this class are meant to assess your proficiency on a specific set of learning objectives.
Each quiz will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate proficiency/mastery in for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 quizzes.

## Quiz Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will ultimately all be assessed via quizzes are:
1. Using variables
2. Using definite loops
3. Using indefinite loops
4. Using nested loops
5. Using conditional statements
6. Using lists
7. Using functions
8. Using returns values
9. Using function parameters
10. Using list parameters with functions
11. Using objects
12. Using classes
13. Using instance variables
14. Using instance methods
15. Using recursion
16. Debugging syntax errors
17. Predicting the behavior of a program
18. Explaining function execution
19. Explaining function scope limits
21. Explaining the difference between objects and classes
22. Explaining how objects are stored in memory
23. Explaining selection sort
24. Explaining insertion sort
25. Explaining merge sort
26. Explaining linear search
27. Explaining binary search
28. Explaining algorithmic efficiency at a high-level
29. Demonstrating the worst case efficiency of the core sort and search algorithms
30. Explaining the general idea of core efficiency classes
