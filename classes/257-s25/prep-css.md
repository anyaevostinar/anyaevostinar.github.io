## Overview
The webpages you have made so far have been pretty barebones, since you've only been using HTML and focusing on the *structure* of your page. To improve the *style* of your page, you'll need a new language: Cascading Style Sheets or CSS. Today's readings are a quickstart to using CSS.


## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the fundamental difference between and main purposes of HTML and CSS
* Define what an HTML tag and HTML attribute are
* Explain the difference between a CSS class and a CSS identifier
* Define the purpose of a `div` tag
* Explain the order in which CSS elements are prioritized, for example if two CSS elements within a style file contradict, which element style is applied?

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use basic HTML and CSS to make a cleanly styled website
* Explain why we separate out content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) and what advantages that gives us as developers

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you should read the following:
* [Lesson 1: Building Your First Web Page.](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/) (Note: At the end of this page, the author talks about "resetting" browser styles. You do not have to worry about doing this, but do read the CSS as it is a good example of CSS structure.) If you've already done some HTML and CSS, you may find that you can skim this page.

* [Lesson 2: Getting to Know HTML](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/) - there is some repetition from the previous HTML reading, so feel free to skip the parts you are already familiar with

* [Lesson 3: Getting to Know CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/) Feel free to poke around the rest of the site as well, particularly if you've already done some HTML and CSS and know the basics.

* Optional: [Making columns](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp) Many groups in the past have wanted to make columns on their website, so here is a guide for that

* Optional: [CSS learning games](https://whatpixel.com/css-learning-games/) If you want to challenge yourself and get better at CSS, try out some of these!

You may also find the [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) tutorials on W3Schools useful. Bonus: you can try out code right in the browser!

## Checks
Submit answers to the following:
* What is the fundamental difference between the purpose of HTML and CSS?
* If two CSS elements within a style file conflict, which one is prioritized?
* What is the difference between and HTML tag and HTML attribute?
