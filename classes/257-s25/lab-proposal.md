## Goal
To get a good start on your project proposal by thinking about your team contract and potential datasets.

## Team Contract
1. Make a Google doc to record notes
2. Discuss with your team your answers to the following:
    1. What are the goals of our team?
    2. What are the strengths of our team and its members?
    3. How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member?
    4. What are the expectations that will guide our team?

Keep track of that Google doc, you'll move the notes to your team repository on Wednesday.


## Datasets
1. Make a copy of the [Dataset Records Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RyhW9aWnEtCwN0zFL_SjW5bUd44TcVzSJDZwez-Arw/copy) for your team
2. Using our [course research guide](https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/cs257) as a starting point, work with your team to identify potential datasets.
    * Important: Verify the sources of publicly available datasets. There are some legitimate people & institutions on Kaggle & GitHub (all of you are already legitimate people on GitHub after the Getting Started Lab last week). However, there are many not-quite-so-legitimate sources. Some datasets may even be AI-generated!
3. Once you've found a dataset, fill in the Dataset Records with your team. There are sections that might not be relevant to you, and it's okay to leave those blank, but make sure to record the following since you'll need them later:
    * URL
    * date downloaded
    * authorship
    * exact name and version
    * terms of use
    * suggested citation
4. Make sure at least one member of your team downloads a copy of the data! 

(If the dataset is small enough, you can and should add the dataset to your team repository on Wednesday.)
