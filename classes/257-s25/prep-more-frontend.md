## Overview
Today's prep is different than usual since there are a lot of different things you might want to do for your website and so I want you to be able to spend time on what makes sense for your team's project. 

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Dive deeper on an aspect of front-end development

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement the aspect of front-end development that you chose to focus on

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, pick at least one of the below resources to read:

* [Website Forms Usability: Top 10 Recommendations](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/) from the Nielsen Norman Group.

* [Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python) - if you want to display a plot/graph on your website, has demos

* W3's [Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp) - same as above but if you like W3's style of tutorial more

* [How to display Matplotlib in Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-show-your-matplotlib-plots-and-pandas-dataframes-dynamically-on-your-website-a9613eff7ae3) - probably should read with one of the previous two (paywalled now unfortunately)

* [Displaying matplotlib in Flask code snippet](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1924163) A non paywalled code snippet

* If you want to learn more about Javascript, read these sections in the W3 schools [Javascript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp):
