## Overview
Today's prep is different than usual since there are a lot of different things you might want to do for your website and so I want you to be able to spend time on what makes sense for your team's project. 

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Dive deeper on an aspect of front-end development

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement the aspect of front-end development that you chose to focus on

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, pick at least one of the below resources to read:

### Forms
* [Website Forms Usability: Top 10 Recommendations](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/) from the Nielsen Norman Group.

### Plots
* [Chart.js introduction](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/usage.html) - if you want to use Javascript for plotting instead of Python
* [Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python) - if you want to display a plot/graph on your website, has demos
* W3's [Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp) - same as above but if you like W3's style of tutorial more
* [How to display Matplotlib in Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-show-your-matplotlib-plots-and-pandas-dataframes-dynamically-on-your-website-a9613eff7ae3) - probably should read with one of the previous two (paywalled now unfortunately)
* [Displaying matplotlib in Flask code snippet](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1924163) A non paywalled code snippet

### Javascript
* If you want to learn more about Javascript, start with the Intro in the W3 schools [Javascript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and jump to whatever looks interesting

### Map
* [Add a Google Map with markers with HTML:](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/add-google-map-wc-tut) You can get a free trial with $300 of Google Cloud credit with your Carleton email, which should be more than enough to get you through a demo for this class.

### World Cloud
* [Word Cloud in HTML & CSS](https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/create-a-tag-cloud-with-html-and-css-1e90)

### Intersections with Gender Studies
* [Javascript is for Girls](https://logicmag.io/intelligence/javascript-is-for-girls/) - if you're interested in the intersection of computer science and gender studies
* [Why Data Science Needs Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/frfa9szd/release/6) - if you're interested in digging more into the ethics of data science (the whole book is great, highly recommend it!)
