## Overview
Today we're going to focus on how to evaluate how well your projects are meeting the requirements of a hypothetical user. Some of this will be review from early in the term, since it's time to evaluate how well you have achieved your desired user stories.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define *user story* in a computer science context
* Write out the "equation" commonly used for user stories
* Define *acceptance criteria* and how it relates to user stories

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain what a user story is and how it's used in user-centered design
* Differentiate between effective and less-effective user stories
* Be able to evaluate if you have achieved support for your own user stories and acceptance criteria

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, review the following in User Stories Applied (linked on Moodle):
* Chapters 1 and 2, "An Overview" and "Writing Stories"

## Checks
Submit the following to Moodle:
* What was one of the user stories your team decided on?
* What were the acceptance criteria for that story?
* What is the specific evidence that shows you've achieved support for this user story (or that you haven't)?
