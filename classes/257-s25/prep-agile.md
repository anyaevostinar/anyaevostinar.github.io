## Overview
There are many different ways to go about organizing large teams and projects. A popular current approach is called *Agile* and today we'll be learning about how to follow this methodology, the history behind it, and getting setup for the term.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Identify the characteristics of effective teams
* Understand the basic components, mindset, and structure of the Agile development process

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain how Agile fits into the history of development processes
* Setup your machine for development of database-backed websites in this class

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you can read the following:

* Google's writeup on [Project Aristotle](https://www.inc.com/michael-schneider/google-thought-they-knew-how-to-create-the-perfect.html), a long-term study Google conducted on the characteristics of effective teams.
* [An Introduction to: Agile Software Development](https://medium.com/shecancode/an-introduction-to-agile-software-development-914339dcec66)
* [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) (if it's been a while since you used Python)
* [Kanban vs. scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum)


## Checks
Submit answers to the following through Moodle:
1. What is Agile?
6. What are one or two of the values and/or principles of Agile that you have a strong reaction (positive or negative) to? What is your reaction and why do you think you have it?
9. How do your experiences working with a team/partner match with the characteristics of effective teams from the articles? How do they differ?
