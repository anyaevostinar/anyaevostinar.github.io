## Overview
There are a lot of levels of organization to think about with large dataset and databases. We aren't going to dive too deeply (since it's a deep rabbit hole), but today we're going to learn a bit about *database normalization* and how we can better organize our tables within a database.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Define database normalization
* Give an example of first normal form and third normal form

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the trade-offs that should be considered when deciding how to structure database tables
* Explain why database normalization is important


## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you should read the following:
* [Database Design and Normalization](https://launchschool.com/books/sql_first_edition/read/normalization#designingtables)

NOTE: You do not need to know the finer details of first normal form vs. fourth normal form, etc. Read these to get a sense of the ways you could, and should, be cutting down on redundancy and inefficiencies in database tables.

## Checks
Write down your answer to the following and bring it to class:
* Identify a real or hypothetical duplication of data in your team dataset (i.e. if you don't think there is any data duplication, come up with a way there could be) and how a normal form could reduce that duplication.
