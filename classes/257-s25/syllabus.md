## Overview

By now, you've taken at least a couple of computer science courses. You know how to program. You might know how to program pretty well. But mostly, you've done small-ish projects with clear guidelines and clear outcomes. You may wonder, how close is your experience so far to that of those who develop software --- to "real world" programming? What do you need to know about how to write software in the real world to be a successful and independent programmer? Further, what do you need to know about how to be ethical in developing software and working with a team and clients?

This course is an introduction to the key concepts of software design, which we'll loosely define as the art and science of effective and ethical software planning, construction, development, and maintenance. In this class, we'll focus on the tools, skills, and ideas that good software developers should use in their day-to-day work. The concepts we'll cover, practice, and discuss will be useful for programs, projects, and teams of any size.

## Course Administration

**Moodle**: all course related materials, assignments, projects, readings, and resources will be posted here.

**CampusWire**: all course announcements and changes to assignments, projects, and readings will be posted here. We'll also use CampusWire for some pre-class discussions about the readings, and as a way to ask and answer questions about projects and such. I also encourage you to use CampusWire to communicate with your project teams. 

**GitHub Classroom**: all starter code for assignments will be distributed here, and your project repositories are hosted here. You will "hand in" most of your projects on GitHub.

**Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Javascript.

**IDE:** VSCode. You should download VSCode to your personal machine.

We'll also be doing a fair amount of work in text editors and the terminal.

**Default environment:** I will default to Mac OSX in class, for development.

I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our physical and virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions should be as inclusive as possible. **Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.**

I strive to create an inclusive and respectful classroom that values diversity. Our individual differences enrich and enhance our understanding of one another and of the world around us. This class welcomes the perspectives of all ethnicities, genders, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities.

## Expectations
I have done my best to design the course so that everyone can be successful, regardless of personal circumstances. 
Communication will be key; please keep me updated about your situation in addition to reaching out to the other relevant offices on campus. 
If you experience significant technological problems that limit your ability to participate, please contact the ITS Helpdesk at 507-222-5999 or helpdesk@carleton.edu. 
For announcements of known technical issues, visit the Helpdesk portal. 
If your personal situation (due to illness or other circumstances) begins to impact your ability to engage with the course, please contact the Dean of Students Office and also let me know.

**I expect you to attend every class session and log in to Moodle and CampusWire every day for updates on activities and assignments.** 

All out of class written communication will happen via the class announcement forum.
Please make sure you are checking it regularly and/or have email or push notifications setup.
Each class day will have preparation activities for you to complete and a section on Moodle to guide you through what you should do before class. 
All materials will be released at least 48 hours before they are due.

### Attendance
Attendance is not strictly required in this class, though it is one main way that you are able to earn "engagement credits," which are a portion of your final grade (see below).

## Getting help
There are many resources available to help you succeed in this course -- please take advantage of any or all of them!

* **Office hours:** Office hours are a great time to clear up any lingering confusion you may have about certain concepts, ask about the daily readings and essay assignments, work through ideas, or just talk about something in the course or in computer science generally or in life thatâ€™s piqued your interest. We will decide as a group at the beginning of the term exactly when office hours should be. Once we've decided, I will post that information here and to Moodle. These time slots are for you, so use them! If for whatever reason you cannot make it to office hours, feel free to make an appointment to see me (info at the top of this page), or send me a message on CampusWire.

* **Lab assistant hours:** The student staff person for this course holds lab assistant hours each week in Olin 310. These are posted on Moodle and I will remind you during the term. There are also lab assistants working in Olin 310 during the afternoons and evenings. These students are great resources for help thinking through debugging strategies, and design options.

* **Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:** Carleton College is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Office of Accessibility Resources (Henry House, 107 Union Street) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attentional, learning, autism spectrum disorders, chronic health, traumatic brain injury and concussions, vision, hearing, mobility, or speech impairments), please contact OAR@carleton.edu or call Sam Thayer (â€™10), Director of the Office of Accessibility Resources (x4464), to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations.

* **Assistive Technologies:** Technological Resources for Students: The Assistive Technologies program brings together academic and technological resources to complement student classroom and computing needs, particularly in support of students with physical or learning disabilities. Accessibility features include text-to-speech (Kurzweil), speech-to-text (Dragon) software, and audio recording Smartpens. If you would like to know more, contact aztechs@carleton.edu or visit go.carleton.edu/aztech.

* **Library:** Library staff can help you find and evaluate articles, books, websites, statistics, data, government documents, and more. You can make an appointment with a librarian, get help via chat 24/7 from any page on the libraryâ€™s website, email, or call. The Library building has lots of great study spaces, and weâ€™d love for you to visit! For more information and our hours, visit the Gould Library website at carleton.edu/library.

* **Student well-being:** Your health and well-being should always be your first priority. At Carleton, we have a wide-array of health and wellness resources to support students. It is important to recognize stressors you may be facing, which can be personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. Sleep, exercise, and connecting with others can be strategies to help you flourish at Carleton. For more information, check out Student Health and Counseling (SHAC) or the Office of Health Promotion.

## Assessment
One of my goals for you in this course is for you to continue to develop as an independent programmer and learner.
I'm much more interested in what skills and understanding you have mastered by the end of the course than the exact pace at which you master them.
However, it isn't healthy for you or me if you leave everything to the last minute. 
It also isn't fair to your team if you haven't prepared as much as they have.
Finally, much of the value of this class comes from engaging with the material and each other throughout the term.
Therefore, my goal with the following evaluation metrics is to balance providing you flexibility to learn at your own pace while also making sure to spread your learning out over the entire term.

Towards that end, your performance in this class will be evaluated in three different ways according to the learning goals for the course:

* **Engagement credits** There is a great benefit to you to fully and authentically engage with the course content in and out of class time. To encourage this engagement while providing some flexibility, the course has an "engagement credit" system. You will need a specific number of engagement credits to earn a specific grade (shown in the list below). You can earn these credits in many ways, but the main way is through completing the preparatory work and attending (and engaging with class). You may earn 1 credit for completely preparatory work satisfactorily and 1 credit for attending and engaging effectively in class. There may be additional ways to earn engagement credits during the term as well.

* **Group deliverables** This course consists of a [team project](project-final) that lasts the majority of the course and has components that you will create and get feedback on along the way. Your work will be evaluated on the effectiveness of the process you and your team utilize, the product you attain (and how closely this product meets the project deliverable requirements), and the effectiveness of your team's collaboration. This contributes to your final grade according to the *specifications grading* scale outlined below.

* **Individual deliverables** Many of the team project deliverables will also have an associated individual portion. The individual deliverables allow you to demonstrate individual mastery of the key learning objectives in this course -- which will provide you with more targeted feedback on your performance. These may be programs or written reflections, depending on the learning goal. This contributes to your final grade according to the *specifications grading* scale outlined below.

### Grading Scale

I'll be using a version of *specifications grading* this term. Each assessment that you hand in will be evaluated against a checklist or rubric related to one or more of the course learning objectives. I will distribute the rubrics and checklists I'll use to assess each assignment so that you know exactly what constitutes each of these levels. I will rank each learning objective, and the overall submission, according to a five-level scale:

* Insufficient evidence (basically nothing turned in)

* Not yet proficient (something was turned in but it did not fulfill the criteria)

* Proficient (the submission demonstrates achievement of the learning objectives)

* Exemplary (the submission demonstrates achievement of the learning objective(s) at a higher level (e.g. more nuance, sophistication, etc).)

An important aspect of specifications grading is revision. **You may revise any group or individual deliverable up until the end of classes.** Learning is not a linear process, and learning involves making mistakes and learning from them. You may revise and resubmit a deliverable at least once, within a week after its assessment has been released. I will keep the higher of the {original, revised} levels (though if you end up with a revised submission at a lower level than the original, we should meet to discuss it).
You may further revise that deliverable before the final submission and [request additional feedback via this form](). However, **you may only request one additional individual and team assessment per week**. 

### How this translates to course grades

**To earn a C in the course:** you must have 75% of the deliverables at "Proficient" and have earned 40 engagement credits.

**To earn a B in the course:** you must have 100% of the deliverables at "Proficient" and have earned 45 engagement credits. If you received Not Yet Proficient on the Midterm Reflection but Proficient/Exemplary on the Final Reflection, you may still earn a B.

**To earn an A in the course:** you must have 90% of the deliverables at "Exemplary", the remaining 10% at "Proficient" and have earned 50 engagement credits.

(There are 28 class days, so by just completing preparatory work and engaging in class, you will earn 56 engagement credits.)

If you have met the deliverables requirements for a letter grade, but not the engagement credits, you will receive that grade with a "-". For example, if you have completed all the deliverables at an Exemplary level but have only 40 engagement credits, you will receive an A-.

### Late work and extensions
In this course, we need to balance flexibility for individuals with structure for teams and the class as a whole. I also want to help you avoid procrastinating to the point that you can't get everything submitted by the end of the term. Therefore, the late work/extension policy varies depending on the type of work:

**All deliverables** have a 1-hour grace period after their posted due date and time to account for slight delays in submission while allowing assessment of submissions to start soon after the due date. If you miss that cutoff, you will still be able to submit something during the revision period. I highly recommend you aim to submit something in the original submission window, even if it isn't complete, so that you can benefit from feedback and revision.

**Preparation work** cannot be submitted late. If you miss the submission for a given day, you cannot earn the engagement credit for that work.

**All work except for the final team submission must be submitted by the end of the last day of classes as per College policy.** The final team submission must be submitted the the end of the last final.
All that said: This (like every term for a while now) term is going to be weird, and hard, and disruptive, for all sorts of non-academic reasons. If you're staring down a deadline that you know you can't meet, or if you've fallen behind, **get in touch with me immediately and we'll work something out.** While I need to put boundaries in place for my own health and wellness, and for fairness to everyone in the class, I also want to make sure you are progressing in your learning.

## AI-Assistance
We are in a new age of software design and development (and everything else) with the arrival of generative AI. 
This term, we will be experimenting with what software design means in the face of these new tools.
You will be expected to use [Github Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-in-your-environment#enabling-or-disabling-github-copilot) for all coding work and allowed/encouraged to use Google's Gemini for additional assignments.
We will spend time as a class exploring where these tools are useful and where they might not actually be helpful.

## Doing honest work

### Groups
Working in groups is a great way to learn computer science, and learning how to work with others is an essential skill. The opportunity to work in groups also comes with some additional responsibilities:

* **As a member of a team, it is your responsibility to contribute equally and fully to the final product.** For example, it is not acceptable to let a teammate "finish the project" without you and put your name on it before submitting it, or work on significant portions of the project without you, or any permutation of this. When pair programming, I expect you to actively work side-by-side with your partner the majority of the time.

* **As a member of a team, it is your responsibility to be able to explain and/or reproduce your solution individually, if asked.** If you do not understand the solution, then you did not contribute fully to the project, and this will hinder your learning of the course material.

* **Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to follow the written and stated guidelines for any particular project.** This includes instructions on the level of acceptable collaboration, restrictions on the tools and resources you can use, etc.

* **Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to credit any assistance you receive.** If you receive assistance from anyone (another book, a lab assistant, a classmate, me), **you must properly cite your source.** I'm not concerned with format---use any format with which you are comfortable. Here's an example of citing assistance in code: if a piece of your program utilizes someone else's idea, you might include the following in your program's comments:

    ```
    # Method to calculate the first ten prime numbers in a series. 
        # Thanks to Mary Smith for helping me fix the logic in the # loop in this method.
    ```

* **It is never acceptable to turn in a program, or a problem solution, that you have found anywhere (on the Internet, in your textbook or another book, from a friend who took this course before) or commissioned as your own.** **Making cosmetic changes to someone else's program or solution (such as changing the variable names or comments) is also not acceptable.**
In general, when you put your name on an assignment or project, you are verifying to me that **this work represents your own work and not the work of someone else.** You should consider putting your name on an assignment, project, or exam as a contract between you, your teammates (if applicable), and me that this work is your own work and not the work of someone else.

Cases of suspected academic dishonesty will be turned over to the dean's office, as per Carleton policy.
