## Overview
In this course, we'll use a Python module called Flask to build our websites. Today's prep gets you started understanding what Flask is and getting Flask installed so that you can focus on coding in class. If you run into difficulties with installation, please reach out asap!

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what Flask is
* Explain what a web framework is
* Describe the tasks that a web framework like Flask carries out
* Have Flask installed on your personal machine

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use Flask to create a basic website
* Use route parameters to dynamically change your website

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you can read the following sections of the Flask Tutorial on [pythonbasics.org](https://pythonbasics.org/) and try out the Hello World app:

1. [What is Flask](https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/)
2. [Flask Tutorial - Hello World](https://pythonbasics.org/flask-tutorial-hello-world/#Hello-World)
3. [Flask Tutorial - Routes](https://pythonbasics.org/flask-tutorial-routes/) (ignore the 'flask route post' section)


## Checks
Submit answers to the following through Moodle:
1. List one advantage of using Flask as opposed to another web framework.
2. What is a route, and how is it used in Flask?
3. What is one route parameter that you could use in your team project that would recreate your command line functionality in the browser?
