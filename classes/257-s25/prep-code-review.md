## Overview
In today's class, you'll participate in a (somewhat) formal code review of your classmates' code. Code reviews are an important part of the software development process. Learning how to give, and receive, constructive feedback on your work is a vital skill for all computer scientists, and one you'll use over and over again in your career.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the goals and process of a code review
* Give an overview of your team's current codebase
* Identify areas of strength and places for improvement in another team's codebase


## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Engage productively in a code review
* Improve your team's codebase based on feedback from a code review

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you can read the following:
* [Code review guidelines](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/524235/Codeplusreviewplusguidelines) from Code Project
* Skim Martin Ch 2 (Meaningful Names) - we will revisit this more in-depth in the future, but these principles are good things to look for during a code review

You will additionally be required to:
* Read and make notes about the code sent to you (info on Moodle under "Code Review Pods"). Pay special attention to the principles of function design that we have been discussing as well as the style principles that you have learned about in previous classes. 

## Checks
Write answers to the following and submit them to Moodle:
1. For your *own* team's project, write a brief overview of your team's design approach and the main classes/functions/decisions that you've made. You will use this to introduce your project code to the people reviewing it, so it should give them a high-level idea of your project codebase
2. For the repository you are assigned to review:
    * 2 or 3 things you like about their code, that you think they should keep doing.
    * 2 or 3 things you think could be improved. Ideally, you should include suggestions on how to make those improvements, but sometimes, you won't be sure how to fix a particular thing.
    * [optional] If there are things about the code that you don't understand, or about which you have questions, you may include a couple of those items at the end of your writeup.

Keep your comments concise. These writeups should be short (typically less than one page) and as simple as you can make them. Also, consider these notes on [providing constructive feedback](https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/courses/cs257_f21/assignments/07_books_code_review.html#helping) as you complete your write-up. You will be sharing your notes with the authors of the code.
