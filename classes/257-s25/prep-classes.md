## Overview
Today we're going to focus on applying the principles of good design to classes and revisit some of the design principles from earlier in the term.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Identify similarities between effective function design and class design
* Define the *single responsibility principle*
* Define *cohesion*
* Define the *open-closed principle*

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Write and refactor classes to have a single responsibility, tight cohesion, and follow the Open-Closed principle

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, read the following in *Clean Code* (the parts that refer to Java specifically are still generally applicable in Python):
* Ch 10 "Classes"

## Checks
