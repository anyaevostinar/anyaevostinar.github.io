## Overview
Writing tests for your code is a vital part of any well-design software project, however there is a school of thought that writing tests *before* you even start your project is the best approach. This is 'test-driven development' and it takes a bit of practice to get the hang of, which will be the goal for today's class.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the basic philosophy behind test-driven development
* Define the terms 'unit test' and 'integration test'
* Explain the basic workflow 'red-green-refactor' in Python using `unittest`

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Argue about the pros and cons of writing unit tests as a mechanism for developing and testing functions
* Use `unittest` to write tests in Python
* Identify edge cases for a basic project

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, you can read the following:
* Wikipedia article on [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). The core idea here is very simple, but as you'll see from the Wikipedia article, it has accumulated a lot of formalism. Read from the beginning up through the "Limitations" section. 
* [Getting Started with Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/). Read up to but **not including** Testing for Web Frameworks like Django and Flask.
* [Professionalism and Test-Driven Development](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2007/03/s3032/13rRUyYBleZ) by Robert C. Martin
* Clean Code Ch 9 - goes more into specific tips

## Checks
Submit answers to the following through Moodle:
* What are the steps to test-driven development?
* What is the basic structure of a test using `unittest`?
* How do you run your tests using `unittest`?
