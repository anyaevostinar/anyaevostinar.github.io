## Overview
You've probably noticed that there are structures that you use over and over again in programming. That idea is called a 'design pattern' and today we'll formalize your understanding of a few of the common ones.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Define "design pattern" in a programming context
* Identify the people who promoted the idea of design patterns originally
* Explain the benefits and criticisms of design patterns
* Define the three "intent" categories of patterns

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain the high-level idea of the singleton, strategy, factory method, and adapter patterns
* Identify how those four patterns are or could be used in your project

## Readings
To achieve the basic learning objectives, read the following:
* [What is a Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern) (including subsections from "What's a design pattern?" to "Classification of patterns")
* Optional: [Python Design Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-design-patterns) - the article is generally assuming you already know what the patterns are and gives opinions on them, which you are welcome to read if you are interested, but not required

## Checks
Complete the prep check on Moodle.
