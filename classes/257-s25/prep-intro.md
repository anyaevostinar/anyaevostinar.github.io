## Overview
Welcome to Software Design!
Most class meetings will have preparation that you should do beforehand and learning objectives that you should be comfortable with before class and after class. 

I know that this first one you might not be able to get done before class, so I've extended the time that you can submit it for credit to tonight at 10pm **just for this prep**.

All of these preparation pages will have checks of some kind that you need to submit and which will be evaluated for completeness. You need to submit a complete check to earn the engagement credit for that day.

## Basic Learning Objectives
These are the learning objectives that each student is responsible for having proficiency at **BEFORE** the class meeting.

If you aren't sure of any of them, you should definitely aim to reach out before the class meeting to clear things up.

Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain how your grade in this course will be determined
* List the learning goals of the course
* Explain very basically what the concepts of software design are

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* List the assignments and structure of the class
* Explain the goals of the course
* Explain at a basic level some ways software can be badly designed

## Readings
I will always include recommended resources (usually readings) where you can find all the necessary answers. However, you are also always allowed to interact with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app) while logged into your Carleton account to achieve the basic objectives and checks.

To achieve the basic learning objectives, you can read the following:

* [Syllabus](syllabus)
* [Schedule](schedule)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following through Moodle:
* What is the criteria for an A in the course?
* Which of the course's learning goals are you most excited about?
* What are the basic concepts of software design?
