## Overview
While you've already been using Git in this course, you might need some more advanced features for your project if you are working on a team.
Existing experience with these features varies widely, so today is focused on making sure everyone has some comfort with the important functionality.
In class will be split between practicing with Git for those who want the practice and working on your project.

* Identify when a merge conflict will happen
* Resolve a merge conflict using VSCode and the Terminal
