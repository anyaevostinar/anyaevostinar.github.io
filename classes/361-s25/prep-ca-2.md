## Overview
There are lots of different things you can do beyond the basic glider in a cellular automaton.
Today's preparation is focused on finding inspiration for something more complex that you want to try  to do.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain one CA pattern other than the glider
* Explain at a high-level how modern CA models have moved beyond discrete cellular automata

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use Empirical to display a grid of varying colors
* Start on making a continuous cellular automata

## Resources
* 3.1 of [Biological Bits](https://users.monash.edu/~aland/BiologicalBits.html) - this is a very short free textbook; if you have Apple devices, you can get the iBook free, otherwise the PDF is linked on the page as well through ResearchGate. The [Game of Life widget](https://users.monash.edu/~aland/BiologicalBits/Life.wdgt/) provided through the book has several examples of other patterns
* [Encyclopedia of Artificial Life Article on Cellular Automata](https://alife.org/encyclopedia/soft-artificial-life/cellular-automata/)
