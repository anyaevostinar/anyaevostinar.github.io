title: Cellular Automata 2 Preparation

## Overview
There are lots of different things you can do beyond the basic glider in a cellular automaton.
Today's preparation is focused on finding inspiration for something more complex that you want to try  to do.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain at a high-level how modern CA models have moved beyond discrete cellular automata

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use Empirical to display a grid of varying colors
* Start on making a continuous cellular automata

## Resources
The following are resources that I think will help you achieve the basic learning objectives. Remember that you can also interact with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) but you should check the answers provided.

* [Encyclopedia of Artificial Life Article on Cellular Automata](https://alife.org/encyclopedia/soft-artificial-life/cellular-automata/)
* [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/) - don't worry if you don't have the machine learning background to understand exactly how they trained the rule set, just focus on how they built upon the basic idea of a CA
* [Lenia Resources](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) - lots of videos and additional pages linked from here

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* How is the Lenia system different than a traditional CA?
* How can CA's be expanded to "grow" and "heal"?
