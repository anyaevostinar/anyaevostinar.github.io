This is a rough schedule of topics for each day and the release and due dates for each assignment.

**Class topics and homework information may change over the course of the term.** Please treat this schedule as a rough guide for seeing what we'll be focusing on, and expect that there will be shifts as the term progresses.

The slide links are all restricted to Carleton folks, so make sure you're logged in to your Carleton account if you have one. If you are outside of Carleton and would like to see them, just shoot me an email!
