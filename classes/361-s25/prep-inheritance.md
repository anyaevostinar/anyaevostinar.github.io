## Overview
Sometimes, you want to have two (or more) classes that share a lot of similar attributes but differ in key ways. There are multiple programming solutions to this situation (other than copy and paste!), but one that we'll focus on today is *inheritance*. You may or may not have seen this previously, so I'm assuming you haven't.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the idea of inheritance in programming
* Identify the C++ syntax for creating a derived class
* Identify the C++ syntax for calling the methods of a derived class

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Create your own base and derived classes

## Resources
You can use the following resources (there are lots of other good ones out there):
* W3Schools [Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_inheritance.asp)
* W3Schools [Polymorphism](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_polymorphism.asp)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* If I have a base class `Organism`, what is the syntax for creating a derived class `Predator`?
* If my base class `Organism` has a public method `move`, what is the syntax for creating a `Predator` object and calling the `move` method?
