## Overview
*Cellular automata* are an example of soft artificial life.
Your [first assignment](hw-ca) will be creating a cellular automaton and the preparation for today is focused on getting familiar with the history and basis for this area.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:

* Explain what a basic cellular automaton is
* Explain what Conway's Game of Life is
* Explain what the *glider* pattern is

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:

* Write a program that supports a *toroidal* spatial structure
* Use the *Empirical* library to visually display a grid
* Start on the cellular automata assignment

## Reading
The following are resources that I think will help you achieve the basic learning objectives. Remember that you can also interact with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) but you should check the answers provided.

* 3.1 of [Biological Bits](/classes/361-s25/BiologicalBits_PDF_edn1.pdf) 
* Complexity Ch 10 (at least up to 'Wolfram's "New Kind of Science"', though you may find the last section interesting)
* [Play Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/) interactive website

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* What is a cellular automata?
* What is Conway's Game of Life and what are the rules?
* What's special about the "glider" pattern?
