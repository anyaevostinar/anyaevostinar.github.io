## Overview
We've briefly discussed the idea of evolving computer programs previously and we'll now be diving deeper into how such "digital evolution" can be implemented with a specific system: Avida. The Avida Digital Evolution Platform is one of the most heavily used artificial life software systems.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* List the standard virtual hardware of an "Avidian"
* Explain what the default Avida "task" environment is
* Explain how "nop" instructions can modify other instructions

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Explain how a digital evolution experiment can be visually represented

## Resources
You should read the following from the paper [Avida: a software platform for research in computational evolutionary biology](avida.pdf):
* 1:Introduction
* 2:Avida Organisms-Virtual Hardware (you don't need to read Template Matching and Heads)
* 2.2.2 Nops as Modifiers
* 3.3 Environment and Resources

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* What is the standard virtual hardware of an Avida organism?
* What is the default "task" environment called?
* How are "nop" instructions used to modify other instructions?
