## Overview
Dr. Luis Zaman will be our next guest speaker this term. To ensure that you get the most out of his lecture and make sure we get some good questions for him, we'll again do the question-asking prep.

## Step 1
Read [Evolution takes multiple paths to evolvability when facing environmental change](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2413930121), making note of questions that you could ask him.

## Step 2
Post at least one question to CampusWire under the "Zaman" category. (Visible to everyone and not anonymous.)

## Step 3
Vote (by clicking the "thumbs up/Like" button) for two other questions.

## Step 4
I will call on the highest vote getters to ask their questions during class.
