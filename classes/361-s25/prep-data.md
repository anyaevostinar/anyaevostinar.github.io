## Overview
While we're generally focused in this class on making GUIs for artificial life software, sometimes you'll also want to collect data more efficiently with your projects.
Today's focus will be on using Empirical's data monitoring tools to output data into files in the "native" version of software (i.e. without the GUI).

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class you should be able to:
* Explain what Empirical's `DataNode` and `DataMonitor` do
* List the types of summary statistics that Empirical provides tools to record

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Using Empirical's data collection tools to record data to files in your own project

## Resources
Read my [Empirical Data Recording Intro](/classes/361-w21/data_intro).

## Checks
Submit answers to the following through Moodle:
* What is the difference between a `DataNode` and a `DataMonitor`?
* What is one summary statistic that Empirical provides tools for collecting?
