## Overview
The final major area we'll discuss is *digital evolution*.
Because evolution is an algorithm that can occur whenever its required components are in place, we can create actual evolving systems digitally.
Today will be focused on some background about this area and one particular system that you are already familiar with, Avida.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain how digital evolution is an instantiation of evolution
* Explain the difference between implicit and explicit fitness

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Implement the components necessary for a simple digital evolution system using Empirical

## Resources
* [Digital Evolution](https://alife.org/encyclopedia/digital-evolution/introduction-to-digital-evolution/)
* Complexity Ch 8 "Self-Reproduction in Computers"
* 7.2 ("Evolution") and 7.3 ("Evolving Ecosystems") of [Biological Bits](/classes/361-s25/BiologicalBits_PDF_edn1.pdf)

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
* Why do we say that digital evolution systems *instantiate* evolution instead of *simulate*?
* What is the difference between "implicit" and "explicit" fitness?
