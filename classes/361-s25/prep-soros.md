## Overview
Dr. Lisa Soros will be our next guest speaker this term. To ensure that you get the most out of her lecture and make sure we get some good questions for her, we'll again do the question-asking prep.

## Step 1
Read [On Creativity and Open-Endedness](https://watermark.silverchair.com/isal_a_00789.pdf), making note of questions that you could ask.

## Step 2
Post at least one question to CampusWire under the "Soros" category. (Visible to everyone and not anonymous.)

## Step 3
Vote (by clicking the "thumbs up/Like" button) for two other questions.

## Step 4
I will call on the highest vote getters to ask their questions during class.
