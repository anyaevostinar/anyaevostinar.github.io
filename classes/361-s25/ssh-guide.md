To connect to `stearns` outside of VSCode, follow this guide.

## Mac
1. On Mac, open the "Terminal" app (not through VSCode!)
2. In the window that appears, type `ssh your_username@stearns.mathcs.carleton.edu`, replacing your Carleton username
3. Enter your Carleton password
4. You are now on stearns and need to use `cd` to navigate around
5. You can use `vi` to edit a file if you remember the commands, otherwise it is probably easiest to make any necessary changes on your local machine, push, and pull onto stearns.

## Windows

2. In the window that appears, type `ssh your_username@stearns.mathcs.carleton.edu`, replacing your Carleton username
