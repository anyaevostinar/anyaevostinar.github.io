## Overview
Dr. Alex Lalejini will be our first guest speaker this term. To ensure that you get the most out of his lecture and make sure we get some good questions for him, today's prep is a little bit different.

## Step 1
Read [Artificial selection methods from evolutionary computing show promise for directed evolution of microbes](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79665), making note of questions that you could ask him.

## Step 2
Post at least one question to CampusWire under the "Lalejini" category. (Visible to everyone and not anonymous.)

## Step 3
Vote (by clicking the "thumbs up/Like" button) for two other questions.

## Step 4
I will call on the highest vote getters to ask their questions during class.
