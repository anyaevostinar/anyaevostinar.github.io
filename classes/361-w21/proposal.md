Your project proposal will serve two purposes: for you to end up with a solid plan for your project and for me to make sure your project fits my expectations and help you improve it where it doesn't. If you are working with a partner, you will turn in each of these documents together.

# Outline
Your outline is due 1/25 and should at least include:

* Topic area you want to focus on (eg parasitism)
* Example real-world organisms/systems with behavior you find interesting
* What that interesting behavior is and why it is interesting?

Optionally, you can also include:
* What are some hypotheses (from the literature or not) on how that behavior could have evolved?
* What axioms can you code to test those hypotheses?
* Bibliography that you have consulted so far or will consult

# Proposal draft
Your draft is due 2/1 so that it can be distributed to classmates for peer review. It should be written in paragraph form and discuss:

* The system/behavior of interest and why it is interesting (ie 'weird' from an evolutionary perspective)
* Your specific research question/hypothesis
* A high-level idea of what axioms you will code to test your research question/hypothesis
* A bibliography of sources you have already consulted or will consult

# Proposal final
Your final draft of your proposal is due 2/5. It should include the same that the draft did but with more polish/edits based on my and your peers' feedback.
