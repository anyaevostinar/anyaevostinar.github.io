Your project proposal will serve two purposes: for you to end up with a solid plan for your project and for me to make sure your project fits my expectations and help you improve it where it doesn't.

# Outline
Your outline is due 1/25 and should at least include:

* Topic area you want to focus (eg parasitism)
* Example real-world organisms/systems with behavior you find interesting
