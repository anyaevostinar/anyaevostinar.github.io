## Goals
To get started on your term project by setting up the configuration manager.

## Logistics
This is a lab assignment that you'll be handing in on Moodle. You should complete it on Wednesday Feb 10th, but it isn't due until Friday Feb 12th at 5:00pm Central.

## Setup
If you haven't already, open the appropriate starter project for your term project. If you already started it, open that Repl.it. If you have a partner, make sure that the group feature is working correctly, ie you both are looking at the same code and can see each other's changes.

## Exercise 1
(If you are using Symbulation as your base, skip this one)
