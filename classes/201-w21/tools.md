## Overview
This document covers two types of tools: video conferencing tools (Zoom); and tools for online coding (repl.it).

## Zoom
All video interactions this term will be conducted through [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), an online video conferencing tool. 
Please update to the latest version since we use some of those features heavily.
My Zoom 'office' is [here](https://carleton.zoom.us/j/8031211072?pwd=WVI1ZFZON2luV1FMT0R5NjVhZHQ0Zz09) and I'll also post this to Moodle.  
There are also Zoom apps for Android/iOS that you can download through the PlayStore/AppStore on your device, and a phone number you can call in to as an alternative way to join the meeting. 
Before our first class, I encourage you to try Zoom (call a friend!) so that you know you can use it on your device. 
The first day of class I imagine we'll all be navigating some challenges with the platform, but trying it out ahead of time will make things a little easier. 
You don't need a camera for our class, although if you have one, that's great; similarly, a microphone isn't required (you can ask questions and participate through chat), but if you have a device with a microphone, that will make it easier to participate.
You aren't required to turn on your camera, though it can help you feel more like you are 'in class'.
You are welcome to attend class meetings in pajamas in bed, I just want you to attend!

## Coding environment
For CS201 this term, the primary way we'll be doing coding is online. We're doing this for two reasons:

* An online coding environment provides the same experience for all students, rather than forcing everyone to try to set up Java and a terminal on their own machines, and that gives all of the course staff more time to support you on the concepts rather than on troubleshooting the setup.
* An online coding environment makes it easier for you to collaborate with one another and for me, lab assistants, and our prefect to see exactly what you're working on when you ask for help.

The environment we'll be using is [repl.it](https://repl.it/).

### repl.it
[repl.it](https://repl.it/) allows you to write and run code in lots of different languages. 
For our class, we'll be using the Java programming language (don't worry, you aren't expected to know it yet!). 
Lab activities and assignments will be released through our Team on repl.it. 

Information on how to join the team coming as soon as I get it!

### Coding on your own computer
I know that some of you may want to use something offline for coding. 
If this is due to internet connectivity reasons, then I'm happy to try to support that. 
If this is not for internet connectivity reasons, then I discourage this due to the advantages above of using an online environment. 
If you do want to install Java on your own computer, we have instructions on the CS website, and if you're using Windows, you many want to consider [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), which is a Microsoft-supported conversion layer which is a safe and easy way for students running Windows to be able to interact with a terminal in the same way as Mac/Linux users. 
If you need help with these resources and the reason you're using them is poor internet connectivity, please contact me via Piazza.

Regardless of why you want to code offline, you should be sure that you have an account on repl.it because you'll need it to access starter files for homeworks and lab activities.
