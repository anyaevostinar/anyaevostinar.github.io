## Overview
Welcome to Intro to CS!
Every class day, there will be a prep page like this that will detail what you should **do** and **understand** *before* class time, as well as what you should do and understand during and after class on the topic.
Today's objectives are mostly about the class structure itself, because it's a little different than you might be used to.

You should always aim to be **proficient** in the *basic learning objectives* before class by going through the readings and videos and completing the specified exercises (and reach out for help ahead of time if you need).

## Basic Learning Objectives
These are the learning objectives that each student is responsible for demonstrating proficiency at **BEFORE** the class meeting (though if you are adding late or don't have a chance to do them before class, just do them as soon as you can!). 
Usually, you will demonstrate this proficiency by completing embedded questions in the readings and submitting answers on Moodle.
Today, you will fill out a background survey, post to the class discussion forum, and answer a Moodle quiz about the syllabus.
If you are having trouble doing so, you should reach out for help before class if you can.

Before class, you should be able to: 
* Explain how this class' grading structure differs from most
* Explain what kinds of collaboration are and aren't allowed
* Explain the overall timeline of when assignments are due and when exams occur
* List and explain the Recurse social rules

## Advanced Learning Objectives
The following objectives should  be mastered by each student during and following our class session through our in-class work:

After class, you should be able to:
* Explain how exams and homework assessment lead to your final grade
* Explain what you'll be able to do after completing this course

## Readings
You should read each of the following:

* [Syllabus](syllabus)
* [Schedule](schedule)
* [Collaboration Policy](collaboration)
* [Recurse Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) - We aren't using the tools mentioned specifically, but this is a good overview for creating a supportive classroom community

## Checks
You should do these checks on Moodle:
* Complete the Homework Partner Preference form if you want a partner for the first homework
* Join CampusWire and post an introduction in "General" with the following:
    * Your preferred name and optionally your pronouns
    * Your class year
    * Why you decided to take this class/what you're hoping to get out of this class
    * One hobby/thing you like to do for fun
* Complete the background survey
* Complete the [Syllabus Check](https://moodle.carleton.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1073104)
