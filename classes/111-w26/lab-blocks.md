Make a folder for today's lab in COURSES ([here are the instructions from the previous lab](getting-started)).

## Exercise 1
Predict the output from the following code fragments:

4a: Regular loop sequences
a)  for i in [2, 4, 6, 8]:
        print(i * i)

b)  for i in range(5):
        print(i, i % 2)

c)  for i in range(3):
        print("Hello", end=" ")
4b: Bounds testing range
d)  for i in range(0):
        print("Hola")

e)  for i in range(3, 4):
        print("你好")

f)  for i in range(3, 3):
        print("안녕하세요")

g)  for i in range(3, 2):
