## Exam Structure
As discussed in the [syllabus](syllabus), the exams in this class are meant to assess your understanding of a specific set of learning objectives.
Each exam will have a posted set of learning objectives that you can demonstrate your understanding of for that quiz, and each learning objective will appear on at least 2 exams.

## Exam Learning Objectives
The learning objectives that will ultimately all be assessed via exams are:

### Building Blocks

#### Core
* BB1: Create and use several variables of different types
* BB2: Write a definite and indefinite loop to perform a given task or produce a given output
* BB3: Write a 2 branch conditional statement
* BB4: Create, access, and change values in a list

#### Advanced
* BB5-AD: Write an indefinite loop that terminates based on unknown input
* BB6-AD: Write a nested loop to produce a given output

### Functions and Recursion

#### Core
* FR1: Define a function with parameters and return value based on a specification
* FR2: Define the [three laws of recursion](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/Recursion/TheThreeLawsofRecursion.html?mode=browsing)

#### Advanced
* FR3-AD: Define and use functions (with parameters and return values) in very clear pseudocode to solve a specified problem
* FR4-AD: Define a recursive function in very clear pseudocode to solve a specified problem

### Object-Oriented Programming

#### Core
* OOP1: Identify classes and objects in example code
* OOP2: Create and change an instance of a given class
* OOP3: Define a class with a constructor, instance variables, and additional method

#### Advanced
* OOP4-AD: Define and use a class (with constructor, instance variables, and methods) in very clear pseudocode to solve a specified problem

### Predicting and Debugging

#### Core
* PD1: Identify and explain syntax or runtime errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`)
* PD2: Predict the behavior of an imperative program with changing variables

#### Advanced
* PD3-AD: Draw a memory diagram for how variables change in a given program
* PD4-AD: Identify and explain logic errors (e.g., variable scope, infinite loop, infinite recursion)
* PD5-AD: Predict the behavior of a program with several functions
* PD6-AD: Predict the behavior of a program with several objects and/or classes

### Algorithms and Efficiency

#### Core
* AE1: Demonstrate the process of insertion or selection sort
* AE2: Demonstrate the process of binary search
* AE3: Identify the worst case efficiency of an algorithm we've talked about in class (eg: sorting or searching algorithms)

#### Advanced
* AE4-AD: Demonstrate the process of merge sort
* AE5-AD: Identify and explain at a high-level the worst case efficiency of a new algorithm similar to those we've discussed in class
