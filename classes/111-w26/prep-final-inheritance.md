## Overview
For your final project, you will build a larger program that uses multiple classes that interact meaningful together with a `graphics.py` based interface. Today, the focus is understanding what you need to do for the final project and learning a bit more about how to define classes that are related to each other.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before the start of class, you should be able to:
* Explain the core and advanced requirements of the project
* Identify the key deadlines of the project
* Explain the idea of inheritance

## Advanced Learning Objectives
During and after class, you should be able to:
* Start on your project proposal
* Explain how you could use inheritance to reduce code duplication in your project

## Readings

You should read the following (note there are a few places where an old checkpoint doesn't show correctly, don't worry about it):
* [Final Project Page](final-project)
* [Runestone 22.1 Class Inheritance](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Inheritance/intro.html?mode=browsing)
* [Runestone 22.2 Inheriting Variables and Methods](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Inheritance/inheritVarsAndMethods.html?mode=browsing)
* [Runestone 22.3 Overriding Methods](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Inheritance/OverrideMethods.html?mode=browsing)
* [Runestone 22.4 Invoking the Parent Class's Method](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Inheritance/InvokingSuperMethods.html?mode=browsing)

## Checks
Complete the [three checks linked here](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Inheritance/ChapterAssessment.html?mode=browsing) (Runestone 22.8 Chapter Assessment) and copy your completed code for the following to Moodle:
* `Grass_Pokemon` `action` method
* `Grass_Pokemon` `attack_up` method
* `Pokemon` `opponent` method
