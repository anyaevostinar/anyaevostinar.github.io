## Overview
In this class, we'll be using the programming language called **Python** to tell the computer what we want it to do.
Today will be focused on getting some basic definitions and functionality in Python figured out.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain what comments in programming are
* Give examples of at least two *values* of different *types* in Python
* Use a built-in/provided function 
* Define the term *variable* in a programming context
* Make a new variable using an *assignment statement*
* Use an existing variable


## Advanced Learning Objectives

After class, you should be able to:
* Create and run a program using VSCode
* Submit programs to Gradescope
* Edit programs based on Gradescope feedback
* Use pair programming to write a program
* Predict what type an expression will result in
* Explain how `int` and `float` values interact
* Explain what it means to evaluate a variable and identify when evaluation occurs


## Readings

You should complete the following Runestone readings and the embedded checks (it looks like a lot, but many of the sections are short):
* [1.10 Comments](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_comments.html?mode=browsing)
* [2.2 Values and Data Types](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/simple-python-data_values-and-data-types.html?mode=browsing)
* [2.4 Function Calls](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/simple-python-data_function-calls.html?mode=browsing)
* [2.6 Variables](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/simple-python-data_variables.html?mode=browsing)
* [2.15 Input](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/simple-python-data_input.html?mode=browsing)


## Checks

Submit answers to the following on Moodle. 

* Write a program that will compute the area of a circle (which is the radius squared, multiplied by pi (3.14)). Have the program work regardless of what value the `radius` variable is set to. Print a nice message back to the user with the answer. Be sure to copy what you write below and save it in Moodle.


<script type="py-editor">
  radius = 5
  #how to compute and print the area?
</script>



* You should also try to join the class' Gradescope so that you are ready for the in-class lab
