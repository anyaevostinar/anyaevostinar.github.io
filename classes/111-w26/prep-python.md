## Overview
In this class, we'll be using the programming language called **Python** to tell the computer what we want it to do.
Today will be focused on getting some basic definitions and functionality in Python figured out.

## Basic Learning Objectives

Before class, you should be able to:
* Explain the difference between an *algorithm* and a *program*
* Edit and run Python programs embedded in the textbook
* Use the `print` function
* Explain what comments in programming are

## Advanced Learning Objectives

After class, you should be able to:
* Create and run a program using VSCode
* Submit programs to Gradescope
* Edit programs based on Gradescope feedback
* Use pair programming to write a program

## Readings

You should complete the following Runestone readings and the embedded checks (it looks like a lot, but many of the sections are short):

* [1.1 The Way of the Program](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_introduction-the-way-of-the-program.html?mode=browsing)
* [1.2 Algorithms](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_algorithms.html?mode=browsing)
* [1.3 The Python Programming Language](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_the-python-programming-language.html?mode=browsing)
* [1.4 Executing Python in the book](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_special-ways-to-execute-python-in-this-book.html?mode=browsing)
* [1.7 A Typical First Program](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_a-typical-first-program.html?mode=browsing)
* [1.10 Comments](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/foppff/general-intro_comments.html?mode=browsing)
* Optionally feel free to read the other sections of Chapter 1, they are all useful and interesting!

## Checks

Submit answers to the following on Moodle (some of these are from the embedded checks and others aren't):
* What is the difference between and algorithm and a program? (1-2 sentences)
* What does the `print` function do?
* How do you write a comment in Python and why would you?

* You should also try to join the class' Gradescope so that you are ready for the in-class lab
