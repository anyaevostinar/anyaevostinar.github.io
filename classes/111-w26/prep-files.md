## Overview
Python is a fantastic language for processing data files and is frequently used in other disciplines for that exact purpose. Today is focused on how to work with text files.

## Basic Learning Objectives
Before class, you should be able to:
* Open, read from, and write to a text file in Python
* Define *csv* format

## Advanced Learning Objectives
After class, you should be able to:
* Use the `read`, `readline`, and `readlines` methods appropriately
* Solve problems that involve analyzing the content of files
* Solve problems that involve writing to files

## Resources
You should read/watch the following:

## Checks
Submit answers to the following on Moodle:
1. Checkpoint 11.3.3: Provide code to find the number of characters in a file `school_prompt2.txt` and assign that value to the variable `num_char`.
2. Checkpoint 11.4.1: Provide code to find out how many lines are in a file `emotion_words.txt`. Save this value to the variable `num_lines`. Do not use the `len` method.
3. What is some data that you'd like to be able to process with Python?
