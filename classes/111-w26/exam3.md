## Learning Objectives

The subset of [learning objectives](exams-overview) that you can demonstrate your understanding of for exam 3 are:

New:
* OOP1: Identify classes and objects in example code
* OOP2: Create and change an instance of a given class
* OOP3: Define a class with a constructor, instance variables, and additional method
* OOP4-AD: Define and use a class (with constructor, instance variables, and methods) in very clear pseudocode to solve a specified problem
* PD6-AD: Predict the behavior of a program with several objects and/or classes

Retake:
* BB1: Create and use several variables of different types
* BB2: Write a definite and indefinite loop to perform a given task or produce a given output
* BB3: Write a 2 branch conditional statement
* BB4: Create, access, and change values in a list
* BB5-AD: Write an indefinite loop that terminates based on unknown input
* BB6-AD: Write a nested loop to produce a given output
* FR1: Define a function with parameters and return value based on a specification
* FR3-AD: Define and use functions (with parameters and return values) in very clear pseudocode to solve a specified problem
* PD1: Identify and explain syntax or runtime errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`)
* PD2: Predict the behavior of an imperative program with changing variables
* PD3-AD: Draw a memory diagram for how variables change in a given program
* PD4-AD: Identify and explain logic errors (e.g., variable scope, infinite loop)
* PD5-AD: Predict the behavior of a program with several functions

You will be allowed to bring [your checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sijOeMtjxBQ0zJ8g_Qv1UYmgpIv8V2apX_M-heI97_w/edit?usp=sharing) with you but there should be no writing on it other than your name and you will submit it with your exam. I'll return them after the exam. If you have lost your original copy, you can print out a new copy to bring.

## Suggestions
Remember that this isn't your only chance to demonstrate your understanding of these learning objectives, so try not to stress too much.
Good ways to study for the exams are:
* Finish any labs that you hadn't finished or redo ones that you did finish
* Go back over the readings/videos relevant to the learning objectives
* Try any of the exercises at the ends of relevant chapters of the Runestone book that are about the learning objectives
* Work on the current homework, since it usually overlaps with the exam objectives
* Attend the prefect sessions
* Try out the [Exam 3 Study Buddy Gem](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1GrkhtOKfL981JbM2Xr9qnZ5D4ITqAq-J?usp=sharing). Remember, these bots can make mistakes, so reach out with questions or if it is doing something strange!
