## About
There are a lot of great resources out there about alternative grading. I felt like collecting them in a list.

## Books
* Grading for Growth
* Grading for Equity
* Ungrading

## Online
* Grading for Growth Substack

## Communities
* [Alternative Grading](https://join.slack.com/t/alternativegrading/shared_invite/zt-3awc2d0qs-rgSYlxpHwl3hbI5A3bE6Fw) Slack

## Examples
These are course syllabuses that use alternative grading (they are going to be mostly CS):
* [All of mine](/Classes) since Fall 2022
* [Swarthmore CS21 F24](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/courses/CS21/F24/standards.html) - Intro to CS with Python
