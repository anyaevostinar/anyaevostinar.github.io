Hello! You can call me Anya or, if you prefer, Prof V. I've broken this page into two sections: Professional Info and Fun Info. Enjoy!

## Professional Info

### Education

* 2017: Dual-PhD in Computer Science & Engineering and Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, & Behavior from Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI

* 2012: BA in Computer Science from Carleton College, Northfield, MN

### Publications
Please see my [research page](/Research/) for information on my current projects and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZwlPwsAAAAJ&hl=en) for my publications.

### Software

* **[Symbulation](www.symbulation.com)** An agent-based modeling program to study the evolution of mutualism and parasitism between a host and endosymbiont species under varying conditions. Lead developer.

* **[Avida](https://github.com/devosoft/avida)** An artificial life platform for the study of evolution of digital organisms. Contributions include programmed cell death, mutualists, and analysis of open-ended evolution.

* **[Empirical](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical)** A library of tools for scientific software development, with emphasis on compiling to the web and building web interfaces using the Emscripten compiler (from C++ to high efficiency JavaScript). Contributions include development of agent-based model to evolve quorum sensing and mutualism.

* **[Stardew Valley Evolution Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2743)** Two modification packages for the game Stardew Valley that add evolution to the fishing and 'slimes'. Supervisor of two students.

* **[Minecraft Sheep Evolution Mod](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/minecraft-sheep-evolution)** This is a mod for the Java version of Minecraft. It enables the evolution of Minecraft sheep via natual selection using an evolutionary algorithm. To accomplish this evolution, we modified the color, reproduction, and life cycle of sheep, as well as the hunting behavior of wolves.
