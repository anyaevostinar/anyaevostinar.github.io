These are links that I think are useful for myself and possibly others.

## Faculty
[Collection of links useful for faculty](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/The-world-of-faculty) - includes negotiation/job-search materials, grant proposals, structuring papers, teaching, and more, some links I pulled out and include in other sections

## Paper Lists
These are my ReadCube lists for various projects that I am mostly sharing here to point my students and collaborators at, but perhaps they will be useful for others as well.
Apologies in advance for the PDFs that didn't get their metadata automatically parsed correctly, if you are particularly interested in a topic, let me know and I can try to go and fix those.
