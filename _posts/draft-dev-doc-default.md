I feel like I've explained how the default mode of Symbulation works about a 100 times, but always in papers or talks and not in the [new documentation](_posts/2021-09-12-dev-doc-readthedocs.md), so it's time to do so.
I'm cross-posting it below, and it's also [here](https://symbulation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/QuickStartGuides/0-Overview.html). 

## Default Mode
Symbulation has several different modes, with more being added regularly.
The main difference between different modes is what organisms populate the world and what they are capable of doing.

The default mode is the original, and also the simplest.
Most of the other modes add functionality to the default.
The default mode consists of a population of **Host** organisms that can have zero or more **Symbiont** organisms living inside of them.
