A few months ago, my friend and colleague [Brooke McCorkle Okazaki](https://www.carleton.edu/directory/bmccorkle/) floated the idea that we co-teach a reading-intensive class that used sci-fi to investigate humanistic themes at the core of artificial life and artificial intelligence. 
I had been already starting to collect sci-fi books that touched on artificial life concepts and enthusiastically agreed to put together an example reading list for a potential class. 
It's not actually decided whether we will be able to do the class, but in pulling together the reading list, I asked many friends about ideas and got back many requests for the full list, so here it is!

Since this is for a potential class, we have it broken out into weeks with each week having a theme that would be explored and discussed together. We also aimed to have the pages assigned be roughly even each week, keeping in mind that some of the text is denser than others.
Since Brooke is a huge Star Trek fan (and I'm a new one), there are also several Star Trek episodes included!
