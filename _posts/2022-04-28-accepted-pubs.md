The SymbuLab has had a very successful ALIFE conference submission process! 
We have FOUR accepted publications directly from the lab and one from the awesome [ECODE Lab](https://ecodelab.com/) using Symbulation; I'm honestly blown away by the awesome work of my students and collaborators!

Here is a list of the preprints for the papers that have them:
* [Keep Your Frenemies Closer: Bacteriophage That Benefit Their Hosts Evolve to be More Temperate](https://ecoevorxiv.org/3qcwk/)
* [Endosymbiosis or Bust: Influence of Ectosymbiosis on Evolution of Obligate Endosymbiosis](https://ecoevorxiv.org/yzce3/)
* [Dirty Transmission Hypothesis: Increased Mutations During Horizontal Transmission Can Select for Increased Levels of Mutualism in Endosymbionts](https://ecoevorxiv.org/7yskd/)
* Extended abstract of [Symbiosis in Digital Evolution: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.739047/full)

We'll also be leading a [tutorial at the 2022 ALIFE Conference on using Symbulation](https://symbulation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ALIFE2022Tutorial/index.html).
I'm very excited for what promises to be a fun (though exhausting conference); looking forward to summer!
