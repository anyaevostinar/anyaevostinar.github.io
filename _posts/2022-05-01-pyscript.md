For a few months (ever since I started teaching Intro to CS in Python), I've been looking for the easiest way to get brand new students practicing with writing Python as quickly as possible. 
I soon was convinced that being able to run Python code in the browser was what I really wanted (since trying to support all of them getting set up with their own machines takes a while). 
While there are great websites out there that [let you run Python in the browser](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit), they all require that I send students to that third-party site, which is an extra step that I chafed at. 
I felt like there had to be an easy way to give them a space to try things out right on this website (since I send them here for readings and labs anyway), but I couldn't find quite what I was looking for.

The fabulous [Acacia Ackles](https://alackles.github.io/) has just solved my problem and I'm ecstatic.
[PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) makes it so blissfully easy to put a Python REPL anywhere that JavaScript is supported, and it's going to open up a whole world of possibility for next year!

I just had to add one JavaScript include line and now I can do this: 

<script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>

Try printing `test`:
<py-repl id="my-repl"> 
test=2
print(test)
</py-repl>

That just looks like this:

```
<py-repl id="my-repl"> 
test=2
print(test)
</py-repl>
```

Bliss!
