* shift mentality away from finish the project and it'll be done like with dissertation or postdoc project, teaching is never done and no amount of prep work will make it perfect the first or second or third time (maybe the tenth, I don't know yet!); you'll only stress yourself out and risk burn out
* teaching requires in-classroom practice and so you have to just accept that you'll mess up and that's okay as long as you learn from it and reflect
* you will write exam or homework problems that are confusing and you won't realize that they are confusing until after your students have submitted answers for grading; it's okay, you can adjust, and you will get better with practice
* you can't fix all your students' problems, just help with some of them and point them to more resources for the others
* research isn't going to look the same as it did when in grad school or postdocing most likely; smaller and done is better than huge and forever in progress
* collaborators are awesome; undergrad researchers are great, but another PhD or otherwise expert in an area is very helpful
* your own website and domain
* when working with undergrads on a research paper, maybe write the outline for them and have them fill in the first draft?
* teaching as an art vs teaching as a science
* * science: if you study and follow the exact same steps as someone else, you will get the exact same results
* * art: if you study and follow the exact same steps as someone else, you will get a flat and uninspired result; great art relies on you feeling something deeply and passionately, which is likely to be completely unique to each individual
* * approaching teaching as only a science will only get you so far
* * if you try to study and follow someone else's teaching style exactly, you will get an uninspiring outcome and the students will suffer for it
* * you can and should study other teachers and understand their approaches, but you ultimately have to approach your teaching based on your emotions and passions to be most effective (and happy, which makes you more effective)
