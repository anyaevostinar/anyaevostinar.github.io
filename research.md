My research is at the intersection of evolutionary biology and computer science. 
I am currently focused on two main categories within that intersection: 
1. studying the evolution of symbiosis by maintaining and using my digital evolution library Symbulation and
2. using digital evolution to create educational games by modifying existing games and gamifying Symbulation's graphical user interface. 

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZwlPwsAAAAJ) profile for my publications and an overview of my main projects below.

            <h4><b>Symbulation</b></h4>
            <p>Symbulation is the first digital evolution library specifically suited for studying the evolution of symbiosis. It can be used to study the effect of many different factors on the evolution of parasitism or mutualism of symbionts.</p>

            <h4><b>Evolution of Mutualism</b></h4>
            <p>Using Symbulation, we verified that increased vertical transmission rate selects for mutualism. However, spatial structure does not strictly increase selection for mutualism; at intermediate vertical transmission rates, spatial structure selected against mutualism to the point of parasitism evolving instead.</p>

            <p>We have implemented the lysis and lysogeny lifecycles of bacteriophage in Symbulation and the possibility for a prophage to provide a benefit or harm to the lysogen. This is a work in progress.</p>

            <p>We have implemented the ability of symbionts to live outside of hosts and engage in ectosymbiosis, enabling the study of the evolution of endosymbiosis from a free-living state. This is a work in progress.</p>

            <p>We have hypothesized that increased mutation rate in the external environment could select for mutualistic endosymbiosis and termed this the Dirty Transmission Hypothesis. We have extended Symbulation to test this hypothesis. This is a work in progress.</p>

            <h4><b>RealisticFishing in Stardew Valley</b></h4>
            <p>We modified the farming simulation game Stardew Valley to include evolutionary dynamics for the fish populations. Players were incentivized to keep the largest fish, however that leads to evolutionary pressure on the fish population to be smaller in adulthood.</p>
